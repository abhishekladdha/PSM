0	Neither of these routes were very complicated but even so it acted <p> like the software <p> was overflowing or getting caught in an endless loop . .
0	I suppose some of the features could have been <p> better implemented into the software <p> design though only because their is a great breadth of information that I wish it could take more advantage of points of interest has more to do with current location proximity though I would like for it to set location according to area route of destination Some of my criticism of the unit in this area may have more to do with the way it might confuse the user who would expect a more straightforward approach to how to utilize certain features and that while getting to a destination you shouldn't have to struggle with why it's not getting to street view current time or whether you are heading to a gas station in the direction you are driving though it's likely I wasn't paying close attention Some of the features were very useful to find areas I have no way of knowing about otherwise though I'm of the impression that on numerous occasions I simply wasn't getting the quickest route and was driving along areas that were scenic or intended to lead to the quickest road in spite of having to drive in the opposite direction for 40 miles in order to reach it . .
