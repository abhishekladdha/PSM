1	The error that was most disturbing was the fact that it sent us the  <i> wrong direction  <i> on an Interstate for 20 miles; had us exit and crossover to enter the Interstate going back the way we'd come for 27 miles!
1	1) It takes long time to acquire satellite 2) Speaker quality is bad 3) Starting & end  <i> direction are very bad <i> .
1	Other than a larger screen, this device moves in the  <i> wrong direction <i> : - the touch-screen reacts unpredictably, much worse than older Nuvis.
1	It doesn't track the finger well at all, no matter how deliberate the gesture, often spinning the screen off in  <i> unpredictable direction <i> .
1	This GPS is great but for older folks who need reading glasses, it is  <i> tough to read the direction <i> .
1	The big issue is it always directs me to go another mile in  <i> another direction  <i> then the faster route to my own home?
1	It shuts off in the middle of giving me direction and when I power it back on, the Garmin screen is displaying something totally irrelevant and starts giving me  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	We missed the directed turn, but were looking right at the store, and went around the block and pulled into the parking lot from the  <i> other direction <i> .
1	Once on freeways (I live in Los Angeles therefore there are a lot of freeways and overpasses) it can give  <i> faulty direction <i> .
1	Overall for somebody with  <i> direction dyslexia <i> , it's a life saver.
1	This GPS is simply poor: the voices are horrible, the comments/ <i> direction are chopped <i> , hard to understand.
1	Couldn't find roads very open and sometimes gave me the  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	Many names and  <i> direction are hard to understand <i> , could not pronounce 'county'.
1	Sometimes gave  <i> wrong direction <i>  to turn.
1	Purchased for lifetime traffic and maps, unit has nice features, exceptional screen, but unfortunaelly compared to my last two Tom-Tom's the  <i> direction are inferior <i> , crazy routes, wrong turns, incorrect street names, a significant difference, enough so that I am going back to a Tom-Tom.
1	It  <i> couldn't figure out which direction <i>  we were going quickly enough (when you first start driving), so we'd miss multiple turns.
1	5) Every now and then its  <i> direction aren't good <i> , aren't clear or are just wrong.
1	Better stay on your toes for an instruction to get back onto the freeway you just exited, going in the  <i> opposite direction <i> , AWAY from your destination.
1	It seems to reset itself often, usually at a critical direction times, has trouble in locating satellites and gives turn  <i> direction late <i> .
1	It would occasionally do something weird like putting me on the highway to  <i> change direction  <i> instead of just taking me around the block but it was pretty good.
1	Although it has a nice big screen and shows the roads and intersections in detail, I have missed turns or took the wrong road on three different occasions, because the stated  <i> direction do not seem to keep up <i>  with my car location.
1	However convenient the Nuvi is, it is prone to  <i> directional errors <i> .
1	So far, this was the only  <i> directional problem  <i> I experienced.
1	In a related problem, I found the  <i> direction to not always be accurate <i> .
1	Also the first time that I used it the  <i> direction were totally wrong <i>  it told me to take a left instead of a right and if I would have followed it I would have ended up in the bushes.
1	I have been disappointed in every aspect--it takes forever to calculate where it is, gets lost regularly, continues to  <i> follow its own direction <i>  instead of recalculating if I choose a different path, is not flexible in finding places, does not show bridges/tunnels, etc even when you are on them(!
1	The following day, the unit finally established a satellite link; however, it remained unreliable, often giving  <i> direction that were completely wrong  <i> in terms of the existing geography.
1	Timing of the spoken  <i> direction is not sensible <i>  once your turn is very close by.
1	If it has to recalculate a route quickly because you missed a turn and perhaps the next viable turn is not too far before you, the unit does  <i> not calculate fast enough to alert you to the new direction <i> .
1	However, it does seem to be too  <i> slow/delayed in giving direction  <i> especially out of parking lots onto major streets/roads/highways and it's not entirely 100% accurate all of the time.
1	I have had major issues with the 3790T, its pretty and worked well and all of a sudden would recalcualte, then the <i>  maps would disappear but the voice direction  <i> would continue.
1	The unit functions, has a brighter display, but the audio is poor, the unit is slow, and it cannot calculate a cross-country trip, says to  <i> follow direction and it will fill in later <i> --"Trust me?
1	I have literally driven in  <i> random direction <i>  for up to 10 minutes before the Garmin finds itself.
1	The units like to tell you your going inone direction, when in fact, you are going the  <i> opposite direction <i> .
1	The only problem I have with this GPS is it is small and I  <i> can't hear any of the direction <i> .
1	We frequently got <i>  bad direction <i> .
1	We live in a major metropolitan area and and it's  <i> terrible for direction  <i> in the city.
1	In areas where there are a lot of streets, it gets confused and sends you in the  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	Have done so dozens of times with this unit and it STILL routes me a  <i> ridiculous direction <i> .
1	Giving  <i> incorrect direction <i>  is infrequent, but a big problem when it occurs.
1	The only think  <i> worse that the direction <i>  is the traffic reports.
1	It loses connection with satellite, there's  <i> delays in direction <i> , wrong signals, no warning before battery dies, touchscreen is not sensitive enough to recognize input, and the list goes on and on.
1	The Garmin took me through a shopping area with lots of traffic lights and  <i> confusing direction <i>  including telling me to make an illegal left turn on a very narrow street.
1	Later speaking with my wife she related how she had to tell a coworker direction one time as their Garmin also was giving them troublesome or  <i> confusing direction  <i> too.
1	Another point to note is that on the TomTom, if you think it has a  <i> wrong direction <i>  or marked a two way street as one way etc.
1	I had many issues with the nuvi 350: poor user interface, did not "know" where we lived (town name was in database but not in entry list offered), yielded totally wrong destination town w/test of  <i> direction (lacks quick means to verify routing) <i> , screen resolution too small for effective use, zoom function rather tedious to use, points of interest list included inaccessible (ie, non-public!
1	) gas pumps, came w/out-of-date OS software, user manual had bad  <i> direction & errors <i>  of fact & misleading info, even tech service could not get "clear private data" function to work (they had me try 3 different ways- none worked).
1	No matter where we are going, it gives us  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	The GPS I received almost caused an accident as I tried to navigate the local area with  <i> direction that were totally wrong  <i> (I do know my own neighborhood; it didn't even know when I reached home and would have had me go way past.
1	After a few times of using i had to turn off the "wonderful" lady that tells you the  <i> direction because she was WAY off <i>  the actual map.
1	At times it seems to want to go the  <i> opposite direction <i>  of where we want to go.
1	* Frequently we'll start our journey on the street in front of our house and the system will plot our route assuming we're facing the  <i> opposite direction <i>  from how we're actually oriented.
1	I found the product  <i> slow to load up the direction <i> , difficult to re-direct to more sensible routes, and not providing all the functionality desired.
1	I finally spoke to a friend who'd suggested the Garmin in the first place and was surprised when he said that his Garmin sometimes gives him  <i> direction that are inefficient <i>  - but he doesn't mind.
1	Since  <i> efficient direction  <i> are the most important part of a GPS to me, I returned the unit.
1	It does not give the  <i> correct direction <i>  you are traveling.
1	Getting from Newark International to Princeton, it gave  <i> confusing direction <i>  right off the bat.
1	Another Nuvi has the  <i> directional problems <i> !
1	The Nuvi is definitely unreliable in long trips and it gave me  <i> wrong direction <i>  on many occasions.
1	Garmin should recall and fix the inaccuracies of their GPS,  or the  <i> erroneous direction <i>  will kill somebody and I will be willing to be on the witness stand.
1	This can be frustrating when your about to make a turn and  <i> loose direction  <i> because of change in power (minus 1.
1	I have used navigators before, this one took a while to get the coordinates and would sometimes get confused on a location and would keep on giving  <i> wrong direction  <i> even after we arrived at the desired location.
1	After updating the maps the direction do not seem to be correct I was driving to Ironstone Vineyards and may several wrong turns and one of the  <i> direction is totally terrible <i>  for a car.
1	The lane direction work good and I think very useful as road signs  <i> never give direction  <i> early enough.
1	One of the locations it pointed was exactly in  <i> opposite direction <i> .
1	From the constant recalculating, slow exit updates, and constant  <i> wrong direction  <i> there was simply not a need for this product.
1	Moving from Point A to Point B, if I start off, and then  <i> lose direction  <i> in a while, it keeps on telling me the first turn from Point A.
1	NOt sure why but often really  <i> goofs up the direction <i> .
1	It also gave me  <i> weird direction <i> .
1	I tried both shortest route and fastest route on different trips but got the same  <i> lame direction <i> .
1	The odd: *  Odd navigation instructions:  Instead of having me turn left in the median when I reach my destination, it tells me to pass my destination, go through two more intersections, make a U-turn, go through those intersections again in the  <i> opposite direction <i> , and then turn right into my destination.
1	I have an inherit fear of using this product because it was giving me the  <i> wrong direction  <i> within my local neighborhood.
1	The  <i> direction it gives is laughable <i>  sometimes.
1	Also,  <i> direction were inconsistent <i> .
1	instead of just inputting zip code or phone number - Can only set one waypoint - Takes you on  <i> weird direction <i>  and not so infrequently - Takes long time to get a satellite fix when turning on far away from where you turned it off - Super expensive map updates.
1	This would be specially useful, for those time the unit keeps directing you through that street that is planned to be built within the next 10 years, or that street they keep working on, or the street happens to be the  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	Review of Garmin nuvi 1450 This is an incredibly frustrating product to use, and is often  <i> unreliable for direction <i>  (as in WRONG).
1	The map  <i> direction are awful <i> .
1	If you plan on using this on a street with more than one lane, you will  <i> not be able to hear the spoken direction  <i> even after it is set to the loudest speaker setting over any external noises.
1	Several times the  <i> direction could have gotten me into an awful  <i> situation.
1	Its  <i> direction are wildly unreliable <i> : 1.
1	1 mile on the left - the device directed me in the  <i> opposite direction <i>  to another entrance 1.
1	It gives plainly  <i> wrong direction <i> : to enter a highway I needed to make 3 immediate right turns - the device told me only about two turns, positioned my car in the opposite direction and ordered to drive 2 miles in that direction south while its (and my) intention was to drive 2 miles north.
1	The trip got no better as it re-booted and miss-directed me through an estimated 3 extra hours of  <i> traffic re-direction <i> .
1	Now this may sound like a mere inconvenience, it is major when it doesn't know which direct to start out, neither do I, and Murphy's Law prevails, I pick the  <i> wrong direction <i>  at which time the little arrow either just sits there as befuddled as I am, or it spins in rotational deliriums trying to figure out what just happened.
1	It sometimes says to "turn right/left", when that actually is the  <i> opposite direction  <i> that you should go.
1	The first 6 weeks I owned this device to replace another GPS it kept giving me  <i> crazy direction <i>  that were not anything like the fastest route from one place to another - like taking you MILES out of your way for a short trip.
1	I got lost SO many times, because it gave me  <i> wrong direction <i> , taken me for multiple unnecessary loops, and didn't recognize parks (you cannot go thru the park, you always need to go around it).
1	I had it once take me to a completely  <i> wrong direction <i>  - just a random spot on a map!
1	So far It has given  <i> bad direction <i> .
1	When I came to a fork in the road each GPS <i> gave me different direction <i> .
1	I got on the road, missed a turn, garmin recaluculated and directed me to the  <i> opposite direction <i>  than I thought.
1	It's frequently  <i> inaccurate with it's direction <i> .
1	And the spoken turn  <i> direction are frequently not timely <i> .
1	- Most important and  <i> disappointing to me were the direction <i>  I got for a recent trip to Ocean City MD.
1	After a ridiculous 10 minute search time (I am not exaggerating) the GPS finally found our destination, but  <i> botched up the direction <i>  once we were in the city.
1	On my way, I entered into another parking lot and exited back to a previous road; instead of recalculating based on my orientation and GPS location, it started giving me  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	The unit took us over roads that we did not use getting there, one of which was actually dangerous - so narrow that you had to pull over to allow a car to pass in the  <i> opposite direction <i> , dangerous curves, no shoulders, steep drop-offs, and no warning signs.
1	We were  <i> reduced to asking direction <i>  of numerous passersby at different points who could only attempt some broken English to help us.
1	Don't bother calling Garmin to complain about  <i> incorrect direction <i> .
1	the  <i> direction are not first time user friendly <i> .
1	It loses signal and shows  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	I ordered the 1450 because I read the reviews on the later models, which also seem to have many  <i> problems with misdirection <i> , and decided this unit would be best.
1	I have to wait for a while and try again to go through the menu c) And finally, the  <i> direction are so so wrong <i> !
1	It doesn't disappear for a long time, maybe up to ten seconds at a time, but if you are in unfamilliar territory and approaching a freeway interchange or a turn is coming up you could end up going in the  <i> wrong direction <i> , defeating the purpose of owning a GPS.
1	It then started re-calculating the destination, and often tried to send me off in a completely  <i> different direction <i> , away from where I was heading.
1	On the rare occasion it found signals it couldn't orient untill I walked in any  <i> random (and usually wrong) direction <i> .
1	Example: I put in "UPS Store," it listed 10 locations, 20 miles+ behind me in the  <i> opposite direction <i>  and none in the direction I was traveling, even thought there were definitely UPS stores in front of me.
1	It alternates the road in the middle of the driving, and sent me off in the  <i> wrong direction <i> , and then it told me to make a U-turn to go back to the road I was driving on from the start.
1	We used it for the first time in Portland Oregon and several times it had trouble acquiring the satellite and then due to such difficulties we either had <i>  no direction <i>  or it gave us incorrect guidance.
1	More subtly (this I can understand, but it was a notable concern), it could not differentiate between medieval streets and major boulevards: it would have <i>  direction zigzagging <i>  through the narrow streets that are charming when you're on foot, but really shouldn't be navigated by anything larger that a Fiat 500 or Smart car - and subsequently we'd find that we'd started a block from a main road that a human would have directed us to.
1	The volume control would reset on its own, muting calls but making the voiced-over <i>  direction really loud <i> .
1	I had 4 legs to my journey and on 3 of them, the Garmin gave me  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	I could see my destination point on the Garmin (which showed it accurately), yet it gave me the the  <i> wrong direction  <i> to get there.
1	did not take toll roads very  <i> confusing direction <i>  it was difficult to secure any where in the car that was piratical!
1	After reloading the info into it which took 30 minutes of download time; we tested it locally and it turned off/on even while fully charged and then gave  <i> incorrect direction <i> .
1	It worked some of the time, but also made some of the trip very frustrating by wanting us to turn into one-way streets (in the  <i> opposite direction <i> ) and occasionally into streets that where no longer available to cars (for example, converted to dedicated tramways).
1	The  <i> direction is confusing <i>  and not worth it.
1	Sometimes I'd get off for gas and the GPS would recalculate my route in the  <i> opposite direction  <i> of the interstate that I just left!
1	There are some very nice aspects to this unit, I just couldn't get past the  <i> poor direction <i> .
1	There were many instances where it directed me to make turns or not make turns when I knew the  <i> direction was wrong <i> .
1	With so many landmarks spaced together it got confused and started giving  <i> different direction <i>  every few seconds.
1	The first thing I noticed was that the voice  <i> direction, while plenty loud <i> , sounded very raspy like the computer had a sore throat.
1	As we approached the half way point near New York City is where the  <i> direction got very odd <i> .
1	To the units credit it never gave a  <i> wrong direction <i>  and always got me right back onto the highway.
1	It gives  <i> bad direction <i>  for freeway interchanges.
1	I was 30 feet from an interstate on ramp and it wanted me to go in the exact  <i> opposite direction <i>  for 2 miles and then turn around.
1	The unit appeared to function well on the major highways, but in some of the cities and towns,  <i> direction were inappropriate <i> .
1	For example, in Freeport, ME it told us to turn the  <i> wrong direction <i>  to leave town and we found ourselves going down an alley and turning into a parking lot.
1	This unit kept giving me  <i> erroneous direction <i>  and shutting down.
1	Always giving  <i> direction either too late <i>  or too early.
1	Took me  <i> wrong direction <i> , never connected or held a charge.
1	This thing has to give the  <i> worst direction  <i> ever.
1	It's  <i> direction around-town are sometimes laughable <i> .
1	Cons: boots slowly, sometimes provides  <i> inaccurate direction <i>  (like turn where no turns are permitted - and it is not a new road sign), traffic avoidance feature leads to absurd routes and time waste, estimated time of arrival does not account for traffic lights, frequently does not recognise best routes (like misses highway exit that allows for saving 5 minutes.
1	This takes several seconds and often tells me to turn around or turn in the  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	), and once it flat out  <i> missed the direction  <i> altogether, resulting in getting lost downtown in a large city.
1	They come into each other like an upside down V from the way I travel, a typical fork from the  <i> opposite direction <i> .
1	Sometimes it has me go the  <i> opposite direction <i>  I need to go and puts me on a highway only to get off and get back on a lesser road when I could easily have gone a direct lesser road route to reach the same destination.
1	When I lifted my finger off the screen, the map would zoom off in a  <i> random direction <i> , so that the field of interest wasn't on the screen any longer.
1	I have Garmin 200W and wanted to upgrade to 1300 due to finding sats quicker and that part works, but this GPS takes you in very very  <i> strange direction <i> .
1	The  <i> direction the unit give you is wrong <i> .
1	The  <i> direction some time is not correct <i>  or navigate longer and unsuitable way.
1	When I would type in a destination, it would calculate my route then highlight the route I needed to walk like normal, but when I start walking, the dot that represents my current location would not move until I was a block or more into my route (not good when it finally "catches up" and you find out you went a block in the  <i> wrong direction <i> ).
1	In southern Georgia and Florida I had at least 85%  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	Can't even begin to tell you how many times it gave us  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	My gps directed me through a neighborhood I was completely unfamiliar with and when I needed the next  <i> direction it shut off <i> .
1	I got the most  <i> byzantine direction <i> , and when I took the most direct route I already knew, the thing just froze for several minutes.
1	Not only did it take me in all kinds of  <i> crazy direction <i>  and in the wrong place, it totally died on me only 6 weeks after I got it.
1	I changed settings on it and still it did  <i> not take me in the right direction <i>  on a number of occasions.
1	* In Baltimore the  <i> direction actually told me to turn the wrong way <i>  onto a one-way street on two separate occasions.
1	Took forever to locate Satellites, would give turn  <i> direction too far in advance <i> , and was just plain wrong on many occasions.
1	I think I bought it in August 2008 for my wife, who has the  <i> worst sense of direction <i>  of any human being I've ever met.
1	It was okay but the  <i> direction where really weird <i> .
1	Over the past week the unit on 2 separate gave the  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	Very  <i> slow to update direction <i> .
1	Such as "can't find the location",  <i> wrong direction <i> , wrong street names.
1	Secondly, if the Garmin needs recharging (while you are driving) you  <i> cannot see or hear the direction <i>  nor do you get visual.
1	I found the  <i> direction a little complicated <i>  compared to my unit in the car but when I figured it out it worked fine.
1	But I could still count on the voice except when it was telling me the  <i> wrong direction <i>  to turn.
1	In addition, I tested it out while traveling to a location that I familiarized myself with and it kept instructing me to make u-turns and travel in  <i> opposite direction <i>  of where I should have been going.
1	The  <i> direction were wrong <i>  a few times, instead of shorter distance it would take me through shorter time etc.
1	I drive to the same location every Saturday morning when theres no traffic and the Garmin sends me in  <i> different direction <i>  each time.
1	Since then, the last two times I used it, the GPS  <i> changed the direction  <i> mid route.
1	Most frustrating characteristics: poor satellite reception, poor positioning accuracy, slow satellite lock, incorrect routing, unstable and slow browser, frequent system lockup, low speaker volume, poor camera quality, shorter than advertised battery life, no competent tech support, no software support, slow startup, route turn-by-turn  <i> direction screen missing <i> , and very poor screen contrast in daylight.
1	The  <i> direction it gives are bizarre <i> .
1	It is by far easier to use a map, a printout or  <i> no direction <i>  at all.
1	This gps will shut off on you, and give  <i> wrong direction <i> , before the software fix.
1	The  <i> direction were totally incorrect <i> .
1	If you are looking for  <i> complicated direction <i>  in a smaller state, i would advise you to get a better one (not sure which that one is and I am still finding out.
1	Not only does it provide inaccurate routing, often times onto 1 way roads going the wrong way, and extremely  <i> circuitous direction <i> , but it is also unable to locate streets/roads.
1	My maps were completely updated and I experimented with every permutation there was, and still the  <i> direction were miserable <i> .
1	Cons (most important to least): o Trouble with direction: within two weeks, it gave several routing  <i> direction that were nothing short of bizarre <i> .
1	The  <i> poor direction <i>  were neither shorter nor faster to the destinations.
1	Our only concern is that we have found on occasion the Garmin will give us totally  <i> erroneous direction <i> .
1	It kept giving me  <i> wrong direction <i>  and didnt even allow me to view the map because the touch screen keeps freezing.
1	This GPS sends me in the  <i> wrong direction <i>  (constantly) and rarely recalculates.
1	Not only that, the road maps are satistactory accurate, but GPS and voice  <i> direction are totally wrong <i> !
1	I was testing it for the past few days, with different settings, Fast, Shortest, but still, it gives  <i> wrong direction <i> .
1	(4) When first starting out the display lines  <i> don't show the proper direction <i>  and are often out-of-sync with the verbal instructions.
1	I could be a mere four blocks away from the entrance to a highway that went directly to my destination and the GPS would instruct me to go in the  <i> opposite direction <i> .
1	it's totally useless, and extremely stupid and  <i> illogical in it's direction <i>  and recommendations to the user.
