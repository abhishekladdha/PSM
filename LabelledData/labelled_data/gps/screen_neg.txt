1	What I am not happy with is that there is no way to turn off the advertising "offers" that  <i> clutter the screen <i>  without turning off the traffic information completely.
1	The  <i> screen seemed small <i>  and difficult to see Connecting to WiFi was near impossible.
1	This product is great if you dont know where you are going, the only negative thing i have to say is the touch <i>  screen is very hazy <i> .
1	Other than a larger screen, this device moves in the wrong direction: - the  <i> touch-screen reacts unpredictably <i> , much worse than older Nuvis.
1	It doesn't track the finger well at all, no matter how deliberate the gesture, often spinning the  <i> screen off in unpredictable directions <i> .
1	On a single touch, or sometimes with a "drag", it pops up a large detail balloon that  <i> clobbers the entire middle of the screen <i> , exactly where you most want to see something.
1	But while phone touch screens withstand significant pressure, the  <i> screen on this device literally cracked <i>  when the phone slid from my front pocket down under my car seat.
1	Pluses  large screen size   up-to-date points of interest   acquires satellites signals quickly   lane assist option Minuses   <i> poor touch-screen response <i>    can turn off entirely in the middle of a route!
1	The touch  <i> screen just isn't very responsive <i> , even after calibration.
1	I found my old Nuvi 680 unit with the  <i> broken screen <i> , bought the screen on e-bay for $10 and installed on my old unit.
1	-   <i> Touchscreen is poor <i> --cannot control items very well with the touchscreen.
1	It shuts off in the middle of giving me directions and when I power it back on, the Garmin  <i> screen is displaying something totally irrelevant <i>  and starts giving me wrong directions.
1	One last thing:  The amount of information displayed on the map  <i> screen is very limited <i>  compared to other GPSs I have seen.
1	Once in Miami, the battery ran low & without warning the  <i> screen went black <i> .
1	Finally, after 3 months of use the touch  <i> screen froze up <i>  and it was impossible to use and I returned it.
1	In addition, sometimes the touch  <i> screen isn't that responsive <i> , which is a bit annoying.
1	3) The  <i> screen size is a little on the small size <i> .
1	It just had a  <i> black screen of death <i>  sometimes when receiving calls.
1	The second was much worse -  <i> touchscreen froze up <i>  at times, electronic voice became distorted at times, phone wouldn't pair right.
1	While out of town on business I tried to turn it on and all I got was a  <i> black screen <i>  with the word Garmin.
1	Web browser is Ok, but  <i> screen is too small <i>  to view the web pages.
1	The touch  <i> screen became unresponsive <i> .
1	And the GPS often wastes your time with  <i> screens that are useless <i>  -- these are the equivalent of "splash screens" after you select a waypoint, that do nothing other than force you to press another "Start" button.
1	Big  <i> screen don't show more map area <i> , as opposed to 4.
1	i then did a google search to see if maybe i needed to install a driver or something - that's when i found out that a lot of other people who bought this gps were having the same  <i> problem with the touch screen <i>  with no known solution.
1	because the  <i> screen does not work <i> , i will instead recommend the garmin nuvi 50 which is very similar to this one - the only difference i noticed (aside from the fact that the screen has a very good touch response) is that it does not have 'pedestrian mode' which gives the walking directions.
1	(2)  After a few months of use, the  <i> touchscreen became erratic <i> .
1	Certain  <i> screens will not recognized a touch <i> .
1	but the touch  <i> screen is not very sensitive <i> .
1	The Bad:  The touch  <i> screen isn't quite as sensitive <i>  as I would like, which requires you to push far harder than I would normally expect, but certainly not to the point of feeling "rough" or destructive.
1	The traffic is usually off, scrolling through the map  <i> screens is HORRIBLE <i> , the GPS will just shut off in mid route (happened when we really needed directions in a city and thus got lost) and the estimated time is off by 1 hr.
1	The manual warned about  <i> screen freezes <i>  and the unit certainly exceeds at that.
1	But I must have made a typo -- that's a lot of letters on a  <i> small touchscreen <i> !
1	This might be a  <i> problem with the large screen <i> .
1	My old TomTom doesn't have this problem, but the  <i> screen is very small <i> .
1	One part of my  <i> screen is pretty much permanently melted <i> .
1	My unit is horrible to look at now (due to the  <i> damaged screen <i> , not the snot.
1	The touch  <i> screen is unreliable <i>  and spotty.
1	I have the same problem as a customer listed previously - The Nuvi 350 worked fine out of the box, but soon afterward the  <i> screen went to very low contrast <i>  as though the back lighting went out.
1	-Finally, the  <i> screen turned grey <i>  while still navigating.
1	The 1350 seems to acquire satellites slower than the 660 and the touch  <i> screen is at best erratic <i> .
1	Sometimes it becomes  <i> unresponsive to the touch screen <i> .
1	Hi, I bought it 2 months back and within month it was showing me poor or lost satellite reception all the time, this is my second Garmin GPS, first one was stopped working as my  <i> touchscreen was not working <i>  so now it is expensive paper weight.
1	However its touch  <i> screen is horrible <i> , basically useless.
1	The  <i> touchscreen is unresponsive <i>  and requires deliberate keystrokes, mine is particularly unresponsive on the right lower corner.
1	The  <i> screen lags <i>  and it literally asked us turn around in a private driveway.
1	Interacting with the  <i> touch-screen is so frustrating <i>  that I've more or less given up on using this device.
1	I turned the unit on at the beginning of a 10 day roadtrip to discover one third of the  <i> screen black <i> , rendering the unit unusable.
1	Also while having a bigger screen,  <i> LESS info is shown per screen <i>  requiring MORE scrolling than the smaller unit as I like to look at the "data" screen w/ miles traveled, miles to go, time traveled, time sitting, moving, etc.
1	The Nuvi 1350 is my first problem Garmin---- the alphabet  <i> touchscreen for the address input is terrible <i> , requiring numerous touches to connect.
1	After my earlier Garmin Nuvi 650 stopped worked one fine day due to  <i> unresponsive touch screen <i> , I gave the benefit of doubt to Garmin and went ahead and bought this replacement Nuvi 295W.
1	Twice now while I was using the unit the  <i> screen suddenly went whitish-gray <i>  and locks up.
1	7) Some  <i> screens are non-intuitive <i>  and it needs more buttons (either physical ones like the handheld units or soft ones on the touchscreen).
1	" All in all, my old Garmin was more reliable than this one, but unfortunately the  <i> screen on that one just stopped responding <i> .
1	It turned on when I first took it out of the box and then the  <i> screen went dead <i>  and it wouldn't turn on even after being charged.
1	The touch  <i> screen was difficult to use <i> .
1	The first one died ( <i> screen froze <i>  over and over) within a couple of weeks.
1	Also annoying is you're driving along and "poof" the  <i> screen randomly goes black <i> , and if you're lucky, the garmin logo appears, and the GPS reboots itself.
1	Finally the  <i> screen went black <i>  after 14 months of use.
1	The first one, a 1390T  <i> froze on the opening screen <i> .
1	My other main  <i> problem was with the screen <i>  touch sensitivity and multi-touch.
1	And attempting a two finger zoom was terrible and the  <i> screen display often jumped <i>  somewhere else that I was pointing.
1	I am very disappointed with my garmin 1450 GPS whose  <i> touchscreen is so fragile <i>  and unbelieveably it is cracked when I push the poweroff button.
1	I cannot believe it is true when I looked at this "spider web" of  <i> cracked screen <i> .
1	To my most disappointment, I am still in a one-year warranty, however, garmine company refused to repair it by giving a stupid reason that my  <i> screen damage <i>  is out of range of their warranty.
1	 <i> Lack of responsiveness of the touchscreen <i>  is a significant negative feature.
1	Garmin accuracy and audio is included, but a small  <i> screen makes this unit less than perfect <i> .
1	The small  <i> screen makes net surfing a misery <i> .
1	I don't know if it's just my unit or a product-wide problem, but the touch  <i> screen is terribly unresponsive <i> .
1	It loses connection with satellite, there's delays in directions, wrong signals, no warning before battery dies,  <i> touchscreen is not sensitive <i>  enough to recognize input, and the list goes on and on.
1	Bad: The  <i> screen contrast really sucks <i> .
1	However I still don't think there's an excuse for such a  <i> crappy screen <i> .
1	I had an insurance policy on my old Garmin 765T through Bestbuy which I loved, but the pixels in the screen I had a white straightline, and thought the  <i> screen was burning out <i> , so I took the 765T back to Bestbuy and was given the Garmin 2360 LMT, took it home, registered the product and did the current down loads, and current maps.
1	I had the Garmin 2360 LMT GPS for 1 day, and the screen completly went dead, I returned it to Bestbuy and was given another Garmin 2360 LMT, and took that home registered it down loaded the maps and current software, that unit worked for a day and a half and the screen went dead, returned it to another Bestbuy, thinking the first Bestbuy got a bad shipment of GPS's, and received another Gamin 2360 LMT, did the downloads, and that unit worked two days before the  <i> screen stopped working <i> .
1	Went to another Bestbuy and received another Garmin 2360 LMT and that lasted 3 months, and the  <i> screen went dead <i>  on 12-15-2011.
1	DO NOT BUY THE GARMIN 2360 LMT, Customer service at Bestbuy just told me on 12-15-2011 when I returned the Garmin 2360 LMT for the last time, that a number of people are returning their 2360 LMT models for the same problems, the  <i> screen just goes dead <i> , and the unit will not turn back on.
1	The touch  <i> screen is way too responsive <i> ; goes all over the place.
1	My only problem is that the Suction cup lost suction on a glass surface and the Garmin fell,  <i> breaking the screen <i> .
1	It had been on the windshield all day and the next morning it had fallen and is now a paperweight with a  <i> broken screen <i> .
1	I had many issues with the nuvi 350: poor user interface, did not "know" where we lived (town name was in database but not in entry list offered), yielded totally wrong destination town w/test of directions (lacks quick means to verify routing),  <i> screen resolution too small <i>  for effective use, zoom function rather tedious to use, points of interest list included inaccessible (ie, non-public!
1	Also - the touch  <i> screen is incredibly temperamental <i> .
1	The screen size is very usable but the  <i> screen navigation is a bit strange <i>  and could be considerably improved.
1	 <i> screen display makes odd jumps <i>  and view changes when i try to change how high the balloon is flying while i look down at the terrain.
1	The pros: 1) The  <i> screen can get extremely bright <i> .
1	I have mine set at 40% brightness, and I have never had an  <i> issue reading the screen <i>  in the daytime.
1	I have had Garmins since 1998 with no problems: this one is the exception:  <i> couldn't select screen options <i>  by a "touch" but had to press; then it wouldn't power off and then horizontal lines through the screen.
1	Update Nov 2011:  Received a replacement and is working for the 3 weeks I have had it but the "touch"  <i> screen is the same as the one that died <i> ; it isn't sensitive like the prior models I have had and I have to tap or even squeeze the selections.
1	Next, the  <i> screen is jumpy <i> .
1	(They also removed the feature you got by quick-touching the Sat Signal icon taking you to the satellites screen - you have to press and hold the Signal icon for more then 10 seconds to  <i> get the sat screen to load <i> .
1	The touch  <i> screen is not sensitive <i>  and the screen is not clear even I wiped it.
1	Sometimes  <i> screen goes blank <i>  for several seconds to redraw while navigating.
1	The touch  <i> screen is very crude <i> , low resolution, with bad accuracy, way too insensitive even for a resistive touch screen.
1	The  <i> screen fills with ads <i>  while you're driving that are super distracting.
1	2 - The touch  <i> screen is not as responsive <i>  as it should be.
1	- Touch  <i> screen is not as good <i> .
1	It takes so much trying to get it to read my finger on the  <i> touchscreen, it's nearly unuseable <i> .
1	The tough  <i> screen requires too much pressure <i> .
1	I used the "safely remove hardware" button on my PC and the  <i> screen became washed out <i>  with white.
1	Also the touch  <i> screen function is delayed <i> , you have to hold your finger on the screen for a little too long to get a response.
1	The additional  <i> screen real estate is also wasted <i> .
1	bought this unit from walmart because I needed a unit quickly since my magellan 2145's  <i> screen broke during travel <i> .
1	I've had many  <i> issues with the touch screen <i>  of this device.
1	And sometimes when I set out to use it, the  <i> screen seems to freeze up <i>  intermittently and was so fickle, I couldn't even recalibrate it.
1	Trip info  <i> screen contains useless information <i>  (in my opinion), and gives no option to display trip information I deem useful (even though it is readily available somewhere internal to the Garmin).
1	I give this unit a 3 star rating, because I'm sure many will not find the  <i> missing screen information <i>  critical, but if any of you out there are long time TomTom users, and are considering trying Garmin, consider long and hard before you jump ship.
1	The main complaint is that the touch  <i> screen is not responsive <i> , and most of the times, it just locked up in the middle of inputting an addresses.
1	Then the  <i> screen went blank <i> .
1	The  <i> screen memory is so slow <i>  it will make you scream profanities.
1	The Garmin logo would display, the progress bar would activate, the maps would load then the  <i> screen would go blank <i>  and the process would repeat.
1	The touch  <i> screen frequently didn't sense my touches <i> , and I had to press some keys on the keyboard several times, even though the keys lit up, the letters or numbers didn't register.
1	The  <i> screen was nearly impossible to see <i>  outside, even on an overcast day without direct sun with the screen brightness turned up to 100%.
1	Unless it was angled just right I could  <i> barely read what was on the screen <i> , limiting its usability for pedestrian use in finding your way around a strange town on foot or bicycle.
1	The whole  <i> screen turns into bright grey <i>  and you can't see nothing.
1	Touch  <i> screen is not sensitive <i>  enough when you touch icons.
1	The trouble is that the touch  <i> screen is not at all responsive <i> .
1	The  <i> screen just went crazy <i> , turned gray and that was it!
1	I told him what happened, and said that I already tried turning it back on with the car charger, electrical outlet charger and still the  <i> screen is gray <i> .
1	The touch  <i> screen is not very responsive <i> , often taking multiple times to get a letter to work.
1	We moved to this GPS from a TomTom, and i have to say, the lack of ability to show POIs on the  <i> Navigation screen is a big negative <i> .
1	The touch  <i> screen is terrible <i> .
1	Well, now that I've got a 3750 with a cracked, completely  <i> unusable screen <i> , here are my topline thoughts: Pros: - love the size.
1	The turn-by-turn directions are LOUD and clear Cons: -  <i> glitchy touchscreen <i> .
1	That is even more frustrating,  it generally goes where it wants, it is PAINFULLY slow; and pops up balloon windows "click for more information" which you can not get rid of,  <i> prevent you from seeing the screen <i>  and send you to the further information even when you try to scroll past them.
1	It worked fine for the first twenty days then the  <i> screen went blank <i>  with the exception of a little black dot that said press here.
1	I purchased the unit in February and it worked fine until last Sunday, when -- in the middle of a trip -- the  <i> screen suddenly went blank <i> .
1	This GPS works well and performs all tasks with ease, however the touch  <i> screen can be wonky <i>  at times and the volume is VERY low.
1	The problem is simple, the LCD  <i> screen broke <i>  while i was camping.
1	I called costomer support when i finally got to talk support they said the LCD  <i> screen is not under warrenty <i>  at all!
1	This garmine nuvi 1490 touch  <i> screen is way to fragile <i> , Seriously i have an older model (nuvi 400) which has sat in my car for years and was a awesome little gps which never failed to work.
1	It's easy to use for the most part, but the  <i> touchscreen is pathetic <i>  at best.
1	What I do not like and what may cause me to return it is the ads that pop up, which are annoying to look at and interfere with the overall ease of use by cluttering up what is a  <i> pretty small screen <i> .
1	Another minor  <i> problem is the touch screen <i> .
1	The  <i> screen view is choppy <i>  and primitive.
1	The  <i> screen gets distorted <i>  and shows black distorted images when hot.
1	I purchased this model for this feature  <i> tired of touch screen <i>  because my fingers are to big and often hit the wrong letter.
1	The touch  <i> screen responsiveness is erratic <i>  and updating the device is a hassle.
1	First, on the screen that asks you for password, the touch  <i> screen sometimes is not very sensitive <i>  so you need to renter your selection.
1	Third, ocasionally it  <i> takes longer to refresh the screen <i> , although this has not yet caused us to miss a turn.
1	Overall Garmin has a toy like feel, entering the letters is hard, the  <i> screen is not very responsive <i> .
1	First, If the sun is shining the  <i> screen is nearly invisible <i> .
1	Very  <i> low screen resolution <i> , pressure activated and non-responsive touch screen, un-intuitive interface.
1	The touch  <i> screen is terribly slow <i>  and inaccurate causing you to input and re-input the word when trying to type at one third normal speed.
1	Right out of the box, the inconsistent and erratic functioning of the 1450 touch  <i> screen is very frustrating <i> .
1	then later in the trip, the map  <i> screen started to flicker <i> , then it would only half-fill, then blank.
1	Also, I found this touch  <i> screen to be very poor <i> .
1	The  <i> creen went black  <i> after this period of time which of course was disappointing.
1	I own a Garmin Quest, which I dearly love, but the  <i> screen is too tiny <i>  for my eyes, the map capacity is limited, and it does not speak street names.
1	Touch  <i> screen is very insensitive <i> ; you need to press it hard (very hard).
1	I bought it for the large screen, which I really like, however the "speed" readout on the  <i> screen ocasionally stops working <i> .
1	My next model will be the glass touchscreen one, my previous touchscreen model got very hard to enter addressed because the  <i> touchscreen was not responsive <i>  in some areas.
1	Overall, I am happy with this unit as it was purchased at a budget price, however, it is not exceptional for reasons noted below: Pros: * Perfect sized screen * Directions are accurate so far * Map and Traffic updates are lifetime - reducing cost of ownership * Built-in traffic is helpful to alert you to upcoming traffic but could be better - my DROID X phone has much better traffic features Cons: * Touch  <i> screen is poorly designed <i>  as its hard to get the thing to do what you want - where as touch phones are more intuitive * Qwerty keyboard function causes you to make many typing errors * CPU is on the slower side - my 4yr old unit was faster * Map update required like 6GB - it failed because my laptop only had 2GB left - its only because I'm in the tech field that I was able to figure this out (after 1 hour of fussing at that).
1	The 'paper' texture of the  <i> screen may be unpleasant <i>  to some if they use a smartphone but it's an anti-smudge design choice.
1	The  <i> screen resolution is way too low <i> .
1	My only complaints so far have been that the  <i> screen is not as easy to tap <i>  on like the 350.
1	I frequently bristle when I see one bad review in a sea of rave reviews about a product which was written by some jerk who says the product stinks because he couldn't figure out how to turn it on,  or the  <i> screen was too dim <i>  to see in sunlight (which it was), or some other criticism borne of user stupidity.
1	The touch interface on the  <i> screen was very bad <i> .
1	- <i> screen is small <i> , but the graphics are really good, so it works, but I much prefer a larger screen.
1	However I find that on sunny and hot days the  <i> touchscreen is very 'iffy' <i>  and sometimes inoperable.
1	b) The touch  <i> screen is moody <i> .
1	DON'T waste your time with a screen protector from the other sellers because after you spend a lot of time cutting it to fit the screen the touch  <i> screen doesn't work <i>  any more.
1	The first month it was nothing but headaches;  <i> screen would flicker <i> , map detail will be gone (blank screen), it would reboot constantly.
1	Then the speaker died which makes the device much less useful since it is  <i> dangerous to try to read a small screen <i>  for directions while navigating through heavy traffic.
1	Also, when you turn on the traffic function, the  <i> screen gets spammed <i>  with advertisements for the various restaurants, etc.
1	The  <i> screen is low resolution <i>  and doesn't look very good.
1	The  <i> screen has poor viewability <i>  at oblique angles.
1	BUT, because the polarized screen is installed at a perfect 90 degree angle from 99% of all other polarized screens and sunglasses, the  <i> screen is totally black <i>  unless I turn my head sideways.
1	- The touch <i>  screen can be too sensitive  <i> at times.
1	I briefly owned a nuvi 1300 about a year ago and due to  <i> terrible touchscreen responsiveness <i> , I returned it.
1	Although the TomTom has a great looking display and the the 3D look is superb, the operation of the  <i> screen is very sluggish <i>  and the voice prompts are not as helpful as the Garmin.
1	We had the older version of this GPS, it worked great until the touch  <i> screen stopped responding <i>  after 5 yrs.
1	I don't like the touch  <i> screen, it is stiff <i> .
1	My issues: the voice quality on this GPS was poor, the audio cuts off mid sentence when providing directions, the map refresh rate is poor, with frequent freezing between screens, the  <i> touchscreen was not very sensitive <i>  in a specific area on the touchscreen, and the display sometimes spins way off axis when I am on an exit ramp.
1	Supposed to be newer model better features but the touch  <i> screen doesn't respond <i>  very quickly and sometimes not at all around the edges and it takes along time when first turned on to acquire satellites sometimes a couple of miles.
1	Now that -- this time the touch  <i> screen became very insensitive <i>  - it didn't work - sometimes when we touched a number or a character, it didn't respond at all!
1	I used it for just a few times and the  <i> screen stop working <i> .
1	It takes more than 5 minutes to start if it starts at all or just gets  <i> jammed on the splash screen <i> .
1	REALLLLLLY love that feature -nice that you can have the map landscape or up and down, like a cell phone Cons: -The front  <i> screen is reflective <i>  and super finger print prone -Glass looks like it ll scratch really easy.
1	The touch  <i> screen is sensitive sometimes <i>  and other times you have to hit it several times for it to respond.
1	The  <i> screen was too small <i>  for my taste (even at 3.
1	The touch  <i> screen is nowhere near as good <i>  as the cheap Mio GPS that I bought 3 years ago.
1	The Garmin is worse than the Droid in the following ways: 1)  The Garmin's touch  <i> screen is much less intuitive <i> /friendly 2)  The Droid allows voice commands, so you don't have to type in an address.
1	It also, without warning, presses random locations on the  <i> screen causing a variety of different outcomes <i> .
1	Beyond that, the menus and search features are unintuitive and poorly implemented, the touch  <i> screen is of embarrassing quality <i> , often leading to tyyyyppppinngn like thhhhiss and the traffic monitoring suite is so inaccurate that it may as well just flash a green/yellow/red icon at random.
1	I think that this is a potentially great product but a common problem that Garmin has is  <i> problems with their touch screen <i> .
1	In the process of searching for possible fixes for this issue, you see that a large number of Garmin devices have touch  <i> screen problems <i> .
1	The touch screen controls were  <i> not nearly as responsive as my touch screen <i>  phone and I really had to enter the address slowly and carefully for the unit to respond.
1	It constantly froze,  <i> screen turned black <i>  but I could still hear the voice prompts.
1	Touch  <i> screen is erratic <i>  at best and does not respond to the same pressure and finger swiping from one try to the next - just the type of thing you don't need to deal with while you are driving.
1	Believe or not, if you mess around the Garmin's other functions while you in the Destination-Set routing mode, the  <i> screen will sometimes "FREEZE" <i>  and you have no way of "RE-BOOTING" for you to get back on your destination route.
1	After about 2 hours the  <i> screen would repeatedly show <i>  the Garmin logo, then give a bright flash, then go black ).
1	2)Lane assist never shows carpool lanes as one of available lanes (carpool lanes unchecked under avoidances) 3)Map is  <i> gone on the screen <i>  for a second between steps when car charger is connected (i.
1	Here are the issues: - When I was in the middle of the vacation the  <i> screen went white  <i> and would not function again.
1	Although the scrolling feature is very sensitive, the touch  <i> screen often fails to sense <i>  direct finger pressure when you make a choice.
1	Touch  <i> screen was very difficult to use <i> .
1	After searching for an hour or so around Garmin and the internet I found out this  <i> frozen screen <i>  means it's dead (no real manual included with product).
1	- The  <i> touchscreen responsiveness is terrible <i> .
1	You'll often  <i> have to press hard on the screen <i>  like you're pressing a physical button to register the touches.
1	However, my mind changed today when the  <i> screen went black <i>  and the device ceased to work.
1	The  <i> screen keeps going outward <i>  making it unable to use the thing in heavy traffic when you need it the most.
1	Touch  <i> screen is not so responsible <i> .
1	It hangs just when you need it, and map  <i> screen goes blank <i>  for a few seconds.
1	Touch  <i> screen to sensitive <i>  for me, hard to scroll without activating something.
1	The device's  <i> on-screen help is useless <i> .
1	Zooming and moving around on the map is rather painful due to the somewhat  <i> unsensative touch screen <i> , although this is meant to avoid inadvertent input when using gloved fingers.
1	Once those stupid ads popped up, they wouldn't clear from the screen so I could continue navigating (the  <i> screen would freeze <i> ).
1	I've read of other Garmin touch  <i> screen issues <i>  (gpsreview.
1	This product is more than U$350, but the quality is really poor, when you touch the back of this product, you can hear a little sound, this product is very bad finished, the touchscreen is not work well, many time I touched the screen, the  <i> screen is not response <i> , and the Garmin.
1	But after driving for a few minutes the  <i> screen on the unit stopped working <i> .
1	and It has  <i> bad screen line <i> .
1	Second, the GPS  <i> screen is horrible <i> .
1	The refresh / paint rate is horribly slow, and the  <i> screen doesn't respond <i>  if its repainting.
1	The  <i> screen is also horribly insensitive <i> , so you have to make deliberate attempts to touch things The interface is not easy to use, and despite having a five inch screen, the ability to display maps is extremely limited.
1	This means you're constantly zooming in and out to see things, which then burdens you with that  <i> horrible screen paint delay <i> .
1	Over time, the  <i> screen became less sensitive <i>  to entering data to record a favorite location.
1	Build quality seems good, but the shiny black plastic around the edge of the  <i> screen collects fingerprints easily <i> , if you care about that kind of thing.
1	First, the  <i> touchscreen required hard pressure <i>  to push the on-screen buttons.
1	It turned off automatically, while I am driving and also  <i> screen goes white <i>  some time for couple second and than map come back again.
1	About 10% of the left hand side of the screen is now black and the  <i> screen locks-up <i>  in hot weather.
1	The 2nd problem which many reviewers didn't address was the  <i> crappy touchscreen <i> .
1	For those of you who are more worried about getting on with your day than about accidentally holding down the switch for several seconds, it is a complete annoyance, made far worse by the fact that if you slip at all while you are squeezing this button hard, the  <i> screen will shut off <i> , but the unit is not off.
1	Pros: Big screen, loud adjustable voice, easy to use, cool features like Point Of Interest and language options, readable color coding for directions Cons: Touch  <i> screen is slow to respond <i>  or doesn't respond at all at times I'm sad I had to return this product because I loved the pros, but the ONE con was enough to annoy me to the point of returning it.
1	The  <i> screen is not sensitive <i>  for touching, so I have to touch hard and repeat to touch some times.
1	On the particular Garmin nuvi 1390LMT I purchased the  <i> sensitivity of the touchscreen for data entry was unacceptable <i> , it required way too much pressure on some letters and numbers.
1	Touch  <i> screen is not very sensitive <i>  - requires a hard push along with extact placement or does not register the touch.
1	But the worst part was that several times each trip, either the  <i> screen would freeze up <i>  on me, or the unit would reboot itself again and again.
1	The other main disappointment with the 1450LMT is that the touch  <i> screen is a little numb <i> , and I frequently have to hit the screen two or three times with my finger to select something.
1	If you connect the unit to the car charger, the  <i> screen goes blank <i>  and essentially the system reboots itself.
1	Touch  <i> screen moves around on its own <i> .
1	The touch  <i> screen was not sufficiently sensitive <i> .
1	It worked well for not quite 30 days and then the  <i> screen went crazy <i>  and the product simply died.
1	My old Garmin 550 unit is worn out, has many  <i> blemishes on the screen <i> , so I decided to go with a new unit.
1	First of all the  <i> screen is not bright <i>  enough.
1	In addition, the text size on the GPS  <i> screen is too large  <i> and cannot be reduced, in my view hides a lot of the map I want the 5 inch GPS to show.
1	The  <i> screen was locked <i>  and I was not able to operate the unit.
1	The  <i> screen went blank <i> , couldn't reset the unit.
1	Even on the lowest power setting the  <i> screen is too bright <i>  at night.
1	While this may not seem like a big deal the light from the  <i> screen reduces your ability to see <i>  at night (dilates the pupils) and also draws unwanted attention to your vehicle.
1	The web browser is too slow and <i>  screen size makes it almost useless <i> .
1	When the installer began to pull the update file from Garmin, it threw up an  <i> error screen  <i> that states (roughly), "Your computer doesn't have 7GB of free space.
1	It is really a shame that such a great looking GPS with a fantastic  <i> screen just does not work very well <i>  at getting you there.
1	* There seems to be a  <i> little delay with the touch screen <i>  after an entry.
1	Apparently the touch  <i> screen of this model unit has had problems  <i> with premature failure, so I guess we were lucky to get almost 3 years of use out of it.
1	Pros: Large Screen Easy input of addresses Connectivity for upgrading system and maps Fairly quick download times (30 minutes for both the firmware and map) Cons: Touch  <i> screen is buggy <i>  Glare on the LCD Clunky interface Poor routing capability Inaccurate listing of some addresses.
1	The replacement hasn't yet been battle tested, but it exhibits the same disagreeable issues as the first unit except the sporadic resetting -- namely,  <i> horrible touchscreen <i>  performance, useless and unreliable traffic and speed limit information.
1	WHAT I **HATE** - The  <i> touchscreen is awful <i> , just awful.
1	The  <i> touchscreen performance is terrible <i>  (and, yes, I did do a screen calibration on both nuvi 1350s I had).
1	And Garmin's hardware design makes using the  <i> touchscreen a miserable experience <i> .
1	Same problems, AND, the traffic  <i> screens did not display properly <i> .
1	What this means is that the  <i> screen cannot show any more information <i>  than the smaller units.
1	The touch  <i> screen keyboard isn't accurate <i> .
1	Many of the letters on the  <i> touchscreen did not work properly <i> .
1	Many software type glitches; unit repeated would say "recalculating"-- had to shut it off; also often times, an  <i> errorneous screen <i>  would pop up.
1	Most frustrating characteristics: poor satellite reception, poor positioning accuracy, slow satellite lock, incorrect routing, unstable and slow browser, frequent system lockup, low speaker volume, poor camera quality, shorter than advertised battery life, no competent tech support, no software support, slow startup, route turn-by-turn directions screen missing, and very  <i> poor screen contrast <i>  in daylight.
1	The touch  <i> screen is not responsive <i>  as it should be, and while you shouldn't be making changes while you are driving, we do.
1	The number button on the bottom of the  <i> screen was unfunctional <i>  and blacked out although I could read the 123 on the button.
1	) The Nuvi 1300 did not work correctly from day one: - Whole sections of the  <i> screen did not work <i>  - try to type in an address and half the screen would not respond.
1	I have had Nuvi 1300 less than 3 months and now it gives me a  <i> blank screen <i>  when it trys to render directions.
1	The  <i> touchscreen wasn't as fast <i>  to respond to typing in an address as my apple I-phone but it was functional.
1	The first two were refurbished, and the  <i> screen would black out  <i> in 5-10 seconds after startup.
1	Pros: - 5" screen gives considerably more real estate than smaller models Cons: - The  <i> screen real estate is not optimally used <i>  - Touchscreen panning is clunky, pinch zoom in/out gestures would be helpful - Slow to acquire and the POI lookup is painfully slow, looks like it is not indexed properly by location.
1	touch  <i> screen does not work <i>  as well as previous units.
1	You actually have to  <i> press the touch screen with more pressure <i>  then I anticipated.
1	My only really true complaint is that when I have the unit charging in my car the  <i> screen does not stay lit <i> .
1	I have had 2 1390T within a period of less than 2 weeks with the same problem -- it continual  <i> reboots to the Garmin splash screen <i>  and there is no fix (according to Garmin).
1	It kept giving me wrong directions and didnt even allow me to view the map because the  <i> touch screen keeps freezing <i> .
1	When I turn it on it takes about about 3 hard presses to get the screen to come on then the other day when i was driving i wanted to view my map and it wouldnt let me view, the  <i> touchscreen was frozen <i> .
1	I worry everytime I go someone where with this nuvi that my  <i> screen will freeze up <i> .
1	Next, the  <i> screen would flicker <i>  in and out and it would turn itself off despite that it was plugged into the car.
1	I am driving my non air-conditioned 1972 vehicle on the Interstate & notice that the  <i> screen has locked up <i> .
1	The second 1350 still has touch  <i> screen acceptance problems <i>  but not as bad as first Map does not contain many addresses within North America  - even addresses we know are more than 10 years old Map-update download does not work.
1	The  <i> screen isn't as responsive <i>  as when I first reviewed the unit.
1	I pushed hard and the  <i> screen cracked <i> .
1	1) The  <i> screen is not very bright <i> , especially when driving on a sunny day.
1	2) The  <i> screen is not very sensitive <i>  to the touch - frustrating!
1	The Zoom in and out on upper left and right corner of the  <i> screen works slower <i>  than other GPS I used before, and sometimes it even doesn't work at all, just freezes on one zoom level, can't go in or out.
1	The  <i> screen feels cheap <i>  as the plastic is very pliable.
1	I found the  <i> screen to be very difficult to see <i>  during daylight hours.
1	However, I found myself frustrated by my  <i> inability to see the screen <i>  during daylight hours  (when I like to exercise) which makes this device limited.
1	Overall, this is a nice item, but I was  <i> disappointed by the screen  <i> dimness during daylight hours which makes it of limited use for me.
1	At about 6 weeks old it started freezing or going to a  <i> black screen <i> , but would restart and be okay for a while.
1	The touch <i> screen just isn't very responsive <i> .
1	1 the touch <i> screen is very inaccurate <i> .
1	the touch <i> screen isn't always accurate <i> but it doesn't bother me much . .
1	One quibble the touch <i> screen is not sufficiently sensitive <i> for my liking I have a google G1 phone with a much better touch screen . .
1	Also the touch <i> screen doesn't respond really good <i> . .
1	The only problem with the unit was the <i> sluggish touch screen <i> .
1	Did not appear to be in new condition Like I couldn't determine that it was used and broken It most certainly WAS NOT in new condition AND the touch <i> screen did not work properly <i> . .
1	needed to get used to the touch <i> screen not as sensitive <i> as my iPhone . .
1	Two complaints first zooming in or out is tricky if you want to go from a close shot to overall view of route and back the <i> screen refresh is slow <i> and spotty in that mode second street names are not displayed until the zoom level is too close to be of any use situational awareness is poor in areas where you are not familiar with the streets . .
1	Product is pretty good for the money but found that the touch <i> screen could be better <i> . .
1	The touch <i> screen is not as good <i> as my IPhone not as responsive . .
1	I like the large bright display but the touch <i> screen is far from perfect <i> . .
1	The touch <i> screen is not very responsive <i> . .
1	One minor annoyance Touch <i> screen not as sensitive <i> at Nuvi 660 . .
1	The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because the <i> screen will freeze <i> after being on for 4 6 hours .
1	The Garmin's <p> screen is not sensitive <p> . .
1	The touch <i> screen aspect of it is poor <i> .
1	Touch <p> screen is not too precise <p> .
1	Con's Touch <i> screen is could be better <i> . .
1	One complaint I have is that the touch <i> screen is not very accurate <i> and you really have to press to get it to register . .
1	The most recent TomTom I tried had serious keyboard problems I would press the letter A and would get AAAAAAAAA on the <i> screen not helpful <i> when you're on a busy freeway . .
1	The sound is pretty loud and I don't understand why some find it soft The only complaint I have is that the touch <i> screen is not as sensitive <i> as my 765 . .
1	Before purchasing I also read reviews that the <i> screen was to sensitive <i> to touch or not sensitive enough . .
