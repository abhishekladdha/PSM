1	PROs Excellent display and interface Very good routing information Easy to use when it works right CONs Poor product support  <i> Poorly designed software <i>  for updating Garmin devices Quality assurance issues for this product MY EXPERIENCE TO DATE My original device failed within a few months of use.
1	But for those who are undeterred by this device's potential hardware problems, the  <i> software is still disappointing <i> .
1	Garmin  <i> software is less than desireable <i> .
1	Quanlity, use and portability is about the same as a Tomtom but the navigation  <i> software needs much improvement <i> .
1	This  <i> software also lacks location <i> /information of infra-red sensors at stop lights.
1	I believe  <i> software written for this particular GPS has flaws <i> .
1	Overall Life of Unit: All three units that I have owned have showed a  <i> decrease in the software life <i> .
1	The  <i> software will become confused <i>  and loop, will not be able to find the satellite when the vehicle is in the open, and numerous other quirks that cause the unit to become non-functional.
1	And is Garmin throwing an untested product, thinking that customers wouldn't make fuss after throwing $10 on  <i> useless software <i>  (not to speak about the cost of the device)?
1	Not me though, and I will take this matter to my attorney general, if Garmin doesn't clean its act and either fix the  <i> non-functional software <i>  ASAP or refund money to the customer and stop selling  <i> non-functional software <i> !
1	The  <i> software is terribly out-of-date <i> .
1	When we got to the hotel I called Garmin(was on hold for an hour) and was told by one of the technicians that "there is a known  <i> software issue <i>  with these units and we do not have a fix for this".
1	Panning/browsing screen almost impossible (see rubber-band effect) due to  <i> software bugs <i> .
1	biggest disappointment of my life i travel for work and have been lost more since buying garmin and sent down more dead ends does not take quickest route and needed update right after i purchased it but was told  <i> software was to old <i>  HATE IT and will never purchase anything endorsed by or bearing the Garmin trademark.
1	Clearly, the product and its  <i> software were not ready <i>  for public release.
1	Perhaps when Garmin resolves their  <i> software issues <i> , I'll reconsider these new widescreen 1200/1300/1400 models but most likely not now.
1	The  <i> software does not recognize the GPS <i>  when it is plugged into the computer (even though the computer recognizes the device and the software has the correct device number displayed).
1	I read elsewhere that the latest  <i> software update is suspected <i>  as the culprit, but can't confirm it.
1	Second unit had  <i> software issues <i>  that were eventually resolved.
1	I purchased and downloaded the Traffic Camera software and if the unit does not feel like talking or announcing, this  <i> software is useless <i> , because I will never know that there is a camera up ahead.
1	After 14 months in service (3 trips total) our unit developed a  <i> software glitch <i>  causing it to crash on start up.
1	My whole issue is the update/download procedure and Garmin's  <i> buggy software <i> .
1	The first one would  <i> not download the software correctly <i>  - had to ask for Garmin assistance.
1	Sent my first unit back because of  <i> major software problems <i>  and the replacement still has some software problems.
1	The 'net is full of sob stories, obviously these devices have  <i> weak software <i> .
1	Garmin fixed the problem via the mail, but it would have been nice if they caught the  <i> software issue <i>  in beta testing.
1	-I had high hopes for the multiple stop routing feature (delivery to multiple destinations) but the  <i> software isn't very user friendly <i>  and the route plan it lays out isn't even close to being efficient.
1	It worked for me for about 3 days, then steadily developed a  <i> software glitch <i>  that has rendered it inoperable after 3 weeks.
1	It's the perfect size and the hardware is much better than I expected, but the  <i> software is practically worthless <i> .
1	Bottom line, the hardware side is perfect, the  <i> software side is almost useless <i> .
1	Back then, I spent two days dealing with erroneous manuals, usability and user interface concepts from late 80s, lack of customer support, and  <i> buggy desktop software <i> .
1	All Garmin would tell me after suggesting a  <i> useless software <i>  fix that others had reported as not working,is that they no longer supported that model and suggested I purchase a new model.
1	The features and price are attractive, I paid $170, but if it will not connect, the product can  <i> not get software updates <i>  or new maps and you can't download pictures to it.
1	Garmin acknowledges the zoom-out as a common problem with Nuvi 1350T, yet after four different calls with tech support and five or  <i> six hours of reloading software <i> , the device remains unfixed.
1	selling hardware+ <i> software that is so wildly out of date <i>  is unheard of in any other industry.
1	Given the nunmber of user comments, Garmin knows of this problem, but continues to sell units with insufficient memory and not fix its  <i> software issues <i> .
1	They have  <i> archaic software <i>  which doesn't overpower the hardware.
1	I bought it 4 weeks ago, I have many  <i> software error <i>  now with it.
1	I guess my question is "Is Garmin trying to write around a hardware problem or is their  <i> software so unstable <i>  that it has to be re-installed periodically?
1	I missed the Garmin, so after waiting a year for Garmin to work out  <i> buggy software <i> , I decided to try the 1450 once again (the 1450 is the same as the 1490 except for the Blue-Tooth feature which I believe just adds to the already overloaded processor capacity).
1	The  <i> software also fails <i>  to recalculate quick enough on missing a destination in a city downtown.
1	Software features rated 1 out of 5 (poor):  Aside from the issues covered under Hardware, above, there were a number of  <i> concerns on the software side <i> .
1	Overall rating was 1 out of 5 (poor):  I was very disappointed on all fronts, from product quality to  <i> substandard software <i>  to unresponsive customer support.
1	This device's  <i> software has made it all but impossible <i>  to preplan a trip where one intends to take a specific route that is not the fastest route.
1	I haven't had any of the  <i> software problems <i>  that so many others are experiencing.
1	I had this unit for about 4 months and it has stopped mapping due to some  <i> software bug <i> .
1	If a route is created on your device, as long as your route preference is set to "Faster Time", your GPS device will usually prefer taking nearby interstates and highways in most cases as long as our calculation  <i> software does not find an alternative route <i>  that it believes will have a shorter arrival time.
1	This product has a  <i> serious software problem <i> , loosen power connection port and sometimes It can not acquire satellites for 2 or 3 minutes.
1	This unit has a known  <i> software incompatibility issue <i>  that prevents the bluetooth pairing with cell phones.
1	Once done with maps, I  <i> failed to update the software <i>  (which contains traffic updates and other useful functions).
1	"  I don't know if this was because of some  <i> software glitch <i>  or other reason.
1	- The unit had several intermittent  <i> software bugs <i> , like: toggling between full color maps and one color maps at random; mysteriously rebooting itself while driving; and occasionally telling me to take a meandering and time-consuming route when there were much more direct and safer routes available.
1	Updating with the latest  <i> software did not help <i> .
1	The grand abilities of the  <i> software are inadequately served <i>  in this incarnation of a Garmin GPS.
1	I so wish for Garmin's  <i> MUCH older software <i> .
1	My guess is this is caused by a  <i> software problem <i>  and, hopefully, it will be resolve in a future update.
1	If you add a via point (to get dinner or buy gas), or just get off the highway without adding the via point, the Nuvi's  <i> software probably won't pick <i>  the quickest or shortest route back to the highway.
1	From what I've read Garmin has changed a number of things in the hardware which makes me speculate that the  <i> software is not fully compatible <i>  with it.
1	Even worse was that the  <i> software would freeze up <i> .
1	However, I am very disappointed that the map  <i> software it came loaded with is 4-5 years out of date <i> .
1	I am hoping these are  <i> software issues <i>  that will be resolved, if not I be using my old Tom Tom once again.
1	The  <i> software is not as good <i>  as other gps units such as magellan.
1	The latest version of the  <i> software isn't compatible <i>  with a Mac.
1	Garmin's map updater  <i> software is extremely difficult to use <i>  and, in some cases, impossible.
1	Garmin has been great so far, however, the product came with many  <i> useless  software <i>  which I don't need, and it does not give directions quickly; by the time the navigator has recalculated a new route, I've passed the exit or street it was talking about.
1	I attribute this to an underpowered microprocessor or  <i> poor software <i> .
1	Again, either their bluetooth chips are  <i> buggy or their software is <i> .
1	To compound the  <i> shoddy software <i>  Garmin removed features that are found in their lower end models.
1	Many  <i> software type glitches <i> ; unit repeated would say "recalculating"-- had to shut it off; also often times, an errorneous screen would pop up.
1	This gps comes with  <i> defective software <i> , the manufacturer makes you fix it yourself on line,another problem it doesn't come with a cord to fix the software problem.
1	I found out about it on there web site that this model has  <i> defective software issues <i> .
1	This gps will shut off on you, and give wrong directions, before the  <i> software fix <i> .
1	Thank god for the compass in my rear view mirror with  <i> no software <i> !
1	The mapping  <i> software was unable to locate <i>  "The Hermitage" in Nashville, TN.
1	The "Communicator Plug-in" in Garmin  <i> software cannot find <i>  the connected device.
1	I hope Garmin will fix the issue/shortcoming listed above as they all are  <i> software/firmware related issues <i>  that I am pretty sure can be fixed.
1	Have had to return two of these for  <i> software problems <i> , freezing (well documented on the web), garmin will only send a reconditioned unit, seems that if they are having that many problems they should offer new units.
1	The only weakness in my opinion and I am sure it is not model specific is that the <i> mapping software may not be quite as good <i> as my 330 days .
