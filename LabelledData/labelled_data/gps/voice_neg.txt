1	The  <i> voice is sort of herky-jerky <i>  and muffled and has difficulty pronouncing normal American English words.
1	This GPS is simply poor: the  <i> voices are horrible <i> , the comments/directions are chopped, hard to understand.
1	Minuses are: limited traffic availability on this type of system, difficulties switching between screens (limited shortcut buttons), poor sound quality, extremely  <i> limited voice choices <i>  (as compared to Magellan), extremely limited icon choices (as compared to Magellan), awkward and unclear on-line updates and support information, and loss of traffic feature if not on power cord.
1	So i originally bought the 255 model but i think the one i received was defective since it would shut off on its own and the  <i> voice sounded a bit distorted <i>  at times.
1	The second was much worse - touchscreen froze up at times, electronic  <i> voice became distorted <i>  at times, phone wouldn't pair right.
1	The default speaking  <i> voice was just AWFUL <i>  - like a 20 year old computer voice with uneven phrasing and accents.
1	It seemed  like a good deal  but  once the  <i> voice goes  <i>  you are  out of luck  Garmin  charges  $99  to  repair  it  but  you can buy an  new  one for that.
1	They've taken away the option to switch the  <i> nagging voice off <i> !
1	Being British I selected UK English language, but on my unit the UK English  <i> voice doesn't work <i> .
1	You need to  <i> delete the foreign voices <i>  for room, best to buy a SD card.
1	I have purchased this unit last March and  <i> never was able to get voice guidance <i> , Garmin has offered me to fixe the problem but there will be a 90 days turnaround.
1	The  computer-generated  <i> voices are mediocre <i> , though I found the male voice more understandable.
1	When the device plug-in power, it provide pretty  <i> loud guidance voice <i>  (such as left turn at xxx street, etc).
1	The  <i> voice was pretty annoying <i>  and the pronunciation of names of roads was pretty amusing.
1	The  <i> voice recognition is fair <i> , at best.
1	I returned the first unit that I received, due to  <i> POOR voice quality <i>  (Not sure it the problem was the audio chip or the speaker), the second unit receives was the same, I am in the process of returnng the 2nd unit.
1	And the  <i> voice is very shaky <i> .
1	2) Blue tooth - paired with Samsung Vibrant (tmo) i can  hear eco kind of  <i> voice - not so clear <i> .
1	 <i> voice commands where intermittent <i> , rebooting while underway, pop up ads.
1	 <i> voice is slightly annoying <i>  and sometimes hard to understand.
1	This thing is dangerous, has asked us to turn into the ocean and onto non existent highways, thank God the  <i> voice simulator is so bad <i>  it is incomprehensible most of the time, or we would be at the bottom of the ocean.
1	3 - The  <i> voice selection is terrible <i> .
1	Also, the  <i> voice is not easy to understand <i> .
1	Also, the  <i> voice is computer-y <i> .
1	The  <i> voice instructions are replete with erroneous instructions <i> ,i.
1	At high volumes, the  <i> voice is scratchy <i>  and a bit hard to understand properly.
1	Also the  <i> voice guidance is pretty slow <i> , especially in city.
1	I prefer to cut the volumn on that  <i> annoying voice (recalculating) <i>  when I am in areas that are familiar.
1	Built-in  <i> voice (American English Jill) sounds horrible <i>  and slow.
1	Garmin is very slow to acquire satellites, the  <i> voice guidance is tinny <i> , and the distance to make a turn is, at times, inaccurate (Garmin can show another 60 feet to turn when the turn is actually at hand).
1	Besides, due to small internal storage size, you  <i> MUST delete some voice <i>  files from the unit to install a new firmware.
1	GPS Navigator  <i> voice commands are very unclear <i>  and terrible.
1	On the not so good side - We find the GPS  <i> voice to be not as clear  <i> as other GPSs we have used.
1	8)Jills  <i> voice is now very annoying <i>  and rough, maybe new speakers.
1	4) The  <i> voice commands operate only a limited set <i>  of features; the recognition is slow and not always reliable.
1	Secondly, the  <i> voice (we'll call her Brenda) is more tinny <i>  and less amplified as in the other units.
1	Lastly, the  <i> voices on this unit are marginal <i> , at best.
1	2) the  <i> voice on the device is robotic <i> , monotonous and absolutely annoying!
1	" * Robot <i> voice is annoying <i>  and totally unnecessary.
1	* Robotic  <i> voice is also confusing <i> .
1	"  (Pronounce it both aloud in a  <i> robotic voice <i>  and you'll see what I mean.
1	Synthetic  <i> voice (nicknamed Sally) was poor <i>  - sounded like she was gargling all the time.
1	However a co-worker of mine has the Nuvi 3760LMT which is the same device  <i> without voice <i>  control (which sucks by the way), and his unit works perfectly fine.
1	My third and final issue is that the  <i> voice options in Garmin's garage is limited  <i> to say the least.
1	Dislikes in no particular order -  <i> voice choices (2 only) are unintelligible <i>  a lot of the time.
1	) Anyway, I didn't find this product particularly intuitive or user friendly, the  <i> voice activation was pretty much useless <i>  - maybe its designed for people who have had some experience with a GPS.
1	(not a big deal) - Wind noise from window down or music/radio playing - hard to near  <i> impossible to hear the voice prompts <i>  and turn directions.
1	 <i> No voice recognition <i>  (or at least I couldn't find it) 3.
1	Synthesized  <i> voice is horrible <i>  5.
1	Well, the  <i> voice commands are horrible <i> .
1	The first thing I notice about the Garman unit was the  <i> voice was very annoying <i>  and  harsh.
1	I returned the Garman 1490ltm PS there is nothing wrong with the 1490 but that woman  <i> horrible voice <i>  was too much for me to take when driving on a trip.
1	In addition to sometimes having to repeat myself several times, even in a quiet car with the windows closed (and I do not have a strong accent that would make it difficult for the device to understand me), the  <i> voice commands do not have all the functionality <i>  of selecting destinations that the touchscreen-driven menu has.
1	Everything is fine EXCEPT the  <i> voice --everything sounds tinny <i>  or like it is under water.
1	When directions were spoken, the  <i> voice was extremely muffled <i>  and difficult to hear.
1	I found that the picture was always correct, but the  <i> voice was wrong <i> .
1	3) The  <i> voice quality was not good <i> .
1	I did a test and ran my 360 and 1390 at the same time for a trip and found that the timing of the  <i> voice instructions for the 1390 was too slow <i> .
1	The volume control would reset on its own, muting calls but making the  <i> voiced-over directions really loud <i> .
1	Although the TomTom has a great looking display and the the 3D look is superb, the operation of the screen is very sluggish and the  <i> voice prompts are not as helpful <i>  as the Garmin.
1	My issues: the  <i> voice quality on this GPS was poor <i> , the audio cuts off mid sentence when providing directions, the map refresh rate is poor, with frequent freezing between screens, the touchscreen was not very sensitive in a specific area on the touchscreen, and the display sometimes spins way off axis when I am on an exit ramp.
1	The  <i> voice is very annoying <i> .
1	Secondly, the  <i> voice features are lacking <i>  in both audio quality (cheap small speaker) and articulation.
1	The first thing I noticed was that the  <i> voice directions, while plenty loud <i> , sounded very raspy like the computer had a sore throat.
1	However, my biggest  <i> gripe is the voice recognition <i> .
1	In the four months I have owned mine (well both of them, as I returned the first one), it has locked up, the maps have gone blank, reboots for no reason, traffic function disappears,  <i> voice recognition stopped working <i> , and it routes you on exit ramps as it thinks they are faster.
1	The NOT SO GOOD:  In more than one instance, the  <i> voice was wrong  <i> in advising the position ("on the left", "on the right") of a destination.
1	The  <i> voice and arrow would tell me the wrong turns <i>  85% of the time!
1	When I asked customer service if there is a remedy for this, this is what they said: "I will be happy to assist you with this, it  <i> isn't possible to disable the voice  <i> prompts other than muting the sound completely as the unit is designed as a navigational aid and the voice prompts are an important part in this, so will interrupt the music as it is designed to do so to provide you with the routing information.
1	This particular unit though seems to have a  <i> voice issue <i> .
1	The second one still has  <i> voice issues <i>  but maybe not quite as bad but we were leaving on a trip and could do nothing about it.
1	Not sure if there is a  <i> voice problem <i>  with all these units or just our luck to get a couple that did.
1	The  <i> voice volume for Bluetooth is too low <i> .
1	The  <i> voice was tinny <i> , garbled and not loud enough.
1	It's got an  <i> odd voice <i>  though.
1	I find it interesting that the  <i> voices took up so much memory <i> .
1	If you want the street names announced, you get a very  <i> robotic sounding voice <i> .
1	Most important the  <i> voice is pretty feeble <i>  so if you  like to hear music while the GPS is giving voice prompts, forget it.
1	Mio will give  <i> wrong voice <i>  commands where as this one crashed with in a week and not comming back.
1	The  <i> voices on the spoken directions are sometimes unintelligible <i> , with ludicrous mispronunciations.
1	I also found that the  <i> voice feature would "die" <i>  at times and the only way to get it back was to turn off the device and do a soft reboot.
1	Toss in missing roads,  <i> stupid voice pronounciation issues <i> , and you wind up with a 2-star product.
1	- The  <i> voice announcements are stupid <i>  at times.
1	The  <i> voice on it is annoying <i>  and it will not let you program it to a Brittish accent like my old one.
1	I did not have this  <i> terrible voice <i>  on the 320 and the pronunciation of words where correct.
1	Spam ads popping up, it never redirected me from any traffic jams, the  <i> voice prompts were slow <i>  and not very usful in heavy traffic when you need to merge early, I tested the unit side-by-side with my Android Telenav cellphone GPS and the Telenav was 20% faster and provided a better route everytime.
1	The woman's  <i> voice is still too loud <i>  and there is no volume control on the device.
1	The device has several annoying features, not the least of which is the female  <i> voice mispronouncing <i>  names and words, often emphasizing the wrong syllable in a word or phrase.
1	The unit's  <i> voice is rather tinny <i>  with a computer twang  --  something akin to a voice that a computer might have used about 25 years ago.
1	The bluetooth pairing with my iPhone worked fine, but when I talked to people, they complained about  <i> terrible voice quality <i> .
1	Once it locks on, sometimes the <i> voice is very distorted <i> and unintelligible.
1	Not only that, the road maps are satistactory accurate, but GPS and  <i> voice directions are totally wrong <i> !
1	Cons No list of exits no truck routing can't look at all POIs at once must select a category first does not display most towns along a route while navigating no elevation display at all <i> voice command does not work <i> in a noisy vehicle volume does not go high enough for some people trip computer does not display all the information found in the trip computer on other models . .
1	I have not <i> enough time to use voice <i> function yet and have no comments on it . .
1	The <i> voice recognition is kinda slow <i> .
1	also <i> voice recognition does not work <i> most of the time . .
