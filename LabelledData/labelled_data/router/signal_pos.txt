0	A word of caution If you intend to carry an operation device from one location to another over lapping coverage areas you will probably have to manually scan or momentarily stop wi fi and re in able it allowing the device to acquire the higher signal strength transmitter .
0	The setup CD walks you through signal strength prompts so that you find the best location .

0	The corner of my house is now covered and my cellphone is getting a <p> stronger and more stable wifi signal <p> .
0	The <p> signal strength is considerably better <p> .
0	Just as good is the fact that our distant downstairs signal quite a long ways from the upstairs router and the reason I picked up the N900 clearly gained strength from 2 bars before to 4 5 now .
0	As another reviewer has stated I would also suggest setting your 2 4ghz to 217mbps mode for a reliable signal good bandwidth and happy neighbors .
0	Wi Fi reception is not as good as the Linksys was but I can get a <p> decent signal <p> outside or in our warehouse up to about 300 feet away and then it falls off quickly .
0	it's so easy to set up the <p> signal is strong <p> throughout the house and if you're into making adjustments on your settings that's easy too .

1	I was getting 23 Mbps in the same room about 18 Mbps in the next room and then if I moved more than 2 rooms away the signal dropped to 1 Mbps or was lost entirely .

0	The 4500 has a <p> more amplified signal <p> to broadcast the signal farther which can translate into greater throughputs for a given location .
0	What I have found in my testing is that the more amplified signal of the 4500 does equate to better performance overall versus the 3800 with non bonded channels in the 2 4 GHz band and bonded channels in the 5 GHz band though both routers were inconsistent with both finding and maintaining a 5 GHz signal in my most remote test locations .
0	In fact I was able to get <p> good signal <p> two houses down from mine .
1	My internet was always giving me a weak signal until I upgraded to this router .
0	Have been using N600 for quite some time but in a certain part of my house was getting very week signal replaced it with N900 am getting anywhere from 2 to 3 bars depending how I hold my iphone .
0	This is indeed a good router with <p> excellent signal <p> I won't repeat what other people already said .
0	This router packs efficient high power amps on both the 2 4 and 5ghz antennas meaning better throughput throughout the house and <p> better signal and coverage <p> .
0	It fixes some of the problems of the previous crown holder the WNDR3700 such as 5ghz connectivity and signal problems and upgrades the speed to a combined 900mbps on 6 spatial data streams .
1	while its tempting to set 2 4ghz to 450mbps i mean who dosnt want max speed however 450mbpd uses channel bonding 40mhz channel width which will cause interference with your neighbor's wifi signal and also your own if their channel happens to fall under yours .
0	450mbps on the 5ghz band however is recommended because the likely hood of any 5ghz signals is small and to have that signal fall under your 5ghz channel only decreases the chance any problems will arise .
0	signal seems to live up to its claims of being 30% stronger than anything else on the market .
0	Also I might mention that I still get signal in the front of the garage approx 30 yards away from the router and through about 3 walls and a garage door .
0	The <p> signal is still strong <p> on my phone .
1	The only expectation I had that was not met was the range of the signal which is probably only 10% more than my old cheap router .
0	In a nutshell The WNDR4500 was the clear winner for me at the farthest usage point from my router through multiple walls and floors it not only provided a stronger signal but also provided twice the throughput as the EA4500 .
0	2 the Received Signal Strength Indicator RSSI which is a measure of the signal strength at the receiver .
0	The higher the RSSI the stronger your signal and so the better the chance that you will be able to receive content from your router .
0	The N Technology really delivers and <p> signal strength is great <p> even two rooms away with walls separating them .
0	If you have any corners of your house unstairs or downstairs that you haven't gotten a full signal for your electronic toys try the N900 Router .
1	The 3700 was good for awhile but eventually starting regularly dropping the signal .
0	The 4500 had <p> better signal strength <p> all through my house than the 3800 did .

0	Both radio frequencies work fine and I get a <p> strong signal <p> and fast connections.
0	I have <p> great signal <p> at the 2 TVs laptop desktop 2 cell phones and 2 tablets .
0	The result was that our WiFi <p> signal seemed to be sufficiently strong <p> 60 to 75 dBm and reliable in most rooms of our home as well as on our backyard deck .
1	However at the kitchen table where I usually work the WiFi signal was always weak usually 80 to 90 dBm or non existent as the signal would become lost entirely .
0	Upon installing and configuring the new Netgear N900 I immediately set up my laptop on our kitchen table and was pleasantly surprised to see 4 out of 5 bars about 50 to 60 dBm displayed on my laptop's WiFi signal strength indicator where I normally see only 1 or 2 bars I have yet to completely lose my WiFi signal while using this router except during those times when our microwave oven is in operation for short periods .
0	I highly recommend this router to anyone experiencing similar signal strength issues to mine in their home .
0	The reason for my need for a stronger signal is because my PS3 downstairs was having trouble running Hulu after a new neighbor moved in .
0	I have the TV DVD and Roku hooked to the 2G channel and the two computers and X Box connected to the 5G signal .
0	The <p> signal strength is also excellent <p> .
0	But it seems to be worth every penny The <p> signal strength is phenomenal <p> through walls past boiler rooms up the stairs .
0	I still have a signal 3 stories away in my house .
0	In regions of the house where I was getting 1 bar with occasional drop outs the N900 is <p> showing full signal strength <p> .
0	For a residential grade router the <p> signal strength is impressive <p> and have no issues at all when using the WiFi wireless analyzer app throughout my house .
0	I wanted to upgrade it for a better one like Asus RT 56U that could carry a wider range of signal reception and handle heavy traffic bandwidth for online gaming .
0	It let's you setup a temporary signal to share with visitors or like me neighbors you assign the time that you want to allow them to connect to your router from 2 hours to as many months you'd like after the assigned time it will block the signal .
0	Netflix and Amazon movies no longer pause because of signal issues .

0	I had a Netgear RangeMax G router before and I wasn't happy with it I found the signal poor and I had to reboot the router at least once per week .

0	Some were flakey with wired connections while others lacked sufficient radio signal output to reach some of our preferred living areas .
0	The NetGear 4500 was not only a pleasure to install less than 10 minutes it literally blew the doors off any of the other routers when it came to raw signal output from its WI FI radio system .
0	This is no big deal since the 2 4 <p> signal is plenty strong <p> in a location where a repeater was needed before This one unit has single handedly replaced FOUR aging Linksys WRT 54GLs that were previously required to support this same wireless network with wireless G .
0	<p> Signal strength 25 % stronger <p> .

0	The <p> signal on this N900 router is fantastic <p> .
0	Unfortunately this construction does not permit as much of the router signal to leave the house as I had imagined that it would .
0	With today's stick frame construction I am sure that the signal would reach well beyond the house .
0	Instant cure The signal to the back bedroom is strong and constant .
1	This blocked the signal enough where I couldn't connect at the other end of my house .
0	Now I have a <p> strong signal <p> all through my house .

0	On the WNDR4500 the <p> signal strength is strong <p> enough I could leave it set to 'auto' on the other two routers I tested they had to be set manually .
