1	My biggest problem is the touch  <i> pad was not responsive enough <i> .
1	Using my thumb for the touch  <i> pad presented a problem <i>  and was harder than I expected to operate.
1	the touch  <i> pad wasn't as responsive <i>  and the range wasn't as good either.
1	The mouse  <i> pad is terrible <i> .
1	The  <i> pad is just too small <i> .
1	Overall the touch  <i> pad is mediocre <i>  and not as good as a laptop!
1	 <i> Touchpad is jerky <i>  as can be and constantly causes unwanted double taps.
1	The  <i> touchpad is unresponsive <i>  or insensitive.
1	after a week the mouse  <i> pad seem to have a little problem <i> .
1	CONS: The touch  <i> pad is actually terrible <i> .
1	The touch  <i> pad is sometimes very slow <i>  to respond to two-finger scrolling or sometimes not responsive at all!
1	Pros: - Very small but usable - Back lit keyboard - Long battery life - USB rechargeable - Inexpensive Cons: - Track  <i> pad not very sensitive <i>  - Waking it from sleep mode can be troublesome at times - Seems to need a direct line to the wireless dongle The biggest complaint I have is the track pad sensitivity.
1	The left  <i> touch-pad button is way too big  <i> and is unresponsive for many things like re-sizing windows and moving them.
1	Left  <i> touchpad button is too big  <i> and doesn't respond very well.
1	The  <i> touchpad latency isn't very good <i> .
1	The touch <i>  pad isn't nearly as sensitive <i> .
1	I'm just very  <i> disappointed in the touch pad <i> .
1	The bad: + After 2 months the touch  <i> pad stopped working <i> : Only a small corner on the top left side is still working, the rest is insensitive to touch.
1	However, my main issue is that I find the mouse <i>  pad not very responsive <i>  or sometimes to responsive.
1	The tracking on the  <i> touchpad is not very good at all <i> .
1	Pros: - Keyboard works well - Lights up Cons: - Some media buttons are switched (not correct) - Mouse  <i> pad sometimes does not work <i>  correctly (which is annoying) I'm not sure it's worth the price.
1	The  <i> trackpad buttons need to be pushed hard  <i> to register a click.
1	Worked okay the 1st month, but after a 3ft drop off the couch onto a hardwood floor, the  <i> touchpad mouse gave up <i>  and became useless.
1	The mouse buttons are unreliable, and I find the  <i> touchpad to be difficult to use <i> .
1	The  <i> touchpad doesn't react that smooth  <i> but you get used to it.
1	So I exchanged for another, but the new one had the  <i> sensitive touchpad problem <i>  several reviewers have talked about (can easily select, move or launch things accidentally).
1	The right side of the keyboard is a little awkward to access with your thumb having to  <i> jump over the touchpad <i> .
1	The  <i> touchpad was zero functionality <i> , so not much else to say for that feature.
1	The  <i> track pad is very poor <i> .
1	You cannot even type 30-40 characters w/o a signal drop (5-15s) and needless to say this makes the use of the  <i> touchpad VERY annoying. <i>.
1	the worst part, however, is the touch  <i> pad seems to have a mind of its own <i> .
1	The  <i> touch pad performs random move <i> , merge, select, open etc.
1	The  <i> track pad issue  <i> is not a big deal as this is a tablet and I only need the keyboard.
1	The  <i> touch pad mouse control is tempermental <i>  and hard to control.
1	I can only get 5-7 feet before the keyboard and  <i> touchpad begins to drop button <i>  presses and finger scrolls.
1	The buttons below the  <i> touch pad are completely different <i>  than other pictured models.
1	I first used this on my gaming machine that I sit about 2 ft away from and noticed a  <i> slight laggy input when using the trackpad <i> .
1	The real  <i> problem is the touch pad <i> .
1	Tapping the  <i> touchpad produces random results <i> .
1	Cons: The  <i> ouchpad blows <i> , good luck navigating the arrow across the screen without activating a link unintentionally.
1	i did no know so i bought one easy to use 30ft range comes with mouse and right and left click buttons cons: light weight feels cheep with the  <i> mouse pad in the way  <i> it slows down your typing speed you need to hold down the shift key to shift.
1	The mouse moves at different speeds as your finger  <i> glides consistently through the pad <i>  - it was excruciating to get the mouse over an icon.
1	Even if you are comfortable using a cell phone and/or laptop and/or iPod, the use of the  <i> track pad (essential for some functions) is laborious <i>  and futile.
1	 <i> Trackpad isn't very sensitive <i>  but you get used to it.
1	Unless the battery is fully charged the  <i> track pad has serious issues <i>  with skipping around and the sensitivity of it is terrible.
1	I guess in a nutshell the  <i> touchpad is too sensitive <i> .
1	Nice form factor for the HTPC but my chief complaint is the  <i> touch pad is overly sensitive <i>  to "press" so you end up doing the equivalent of right-mouse-button clicking unintentionally.
1	The <i>  trackpad is kinda useless  <i> and tiny for my large fingers.
1	When I use the top-left mouse button + the tp instead dragging works, so it's definitely that left  <i> trackpad key which is not good <i> .
1	The  <i> mouse pad is not as sensitive <i>  (accurate) as I had hoped and is frustrating sometimes.
1	Also, the surface area of the  <i> touch pad is rather small <i>  so it was hard for me to scroll.
1	The keys seem to work ok from that distance, but the  <i> trackpad is very laggy <i>  at about 5M - 6M away.
1	This is a very well made keyboard with nice features, but for me, the  <i> trackpad is too close to the keyboard <i>  which means my pinky kept hitting it, sending the cursor to random places on the screen.
1	The  <i> touchpad no longer works properly <i>  - as you tilt the device, the cursor moves (I gently cleaned it with a dry soft cloth) 3.
1	Clicking on the  <i> trackpad isn't the best <i> .
1	 <i> I was not able to use the trackpad <i>  with any type of precision and it kept registering even the lightest of strokes as clicks.
1	It was difficult to use, and the  <i> trackpad was very unresponsive <i> .
1	One is that the  <i> track pad is very twitchy <i> .
1	It worked great for awhile, and now the mouse <i>  pad doesn't work <i> .
1	On a working unit the only complaint is the  <i> passable sensitivity of the track pad <i> .
1	This integrated keyboard and touchpad is a great idea for a media TV, but the  <i> touchpad is awful <i> .
1	do not buy this if does not work i boust it and when i got it the lazer did not work the worst shipping ever something els was broken inside and to make it worst the  <i> mouse pad did not worck cerecly <i>  and they do not give refunds!
1	Biggest complaint is that it feels awkward to type with thumbs with the trackpad on the right side and that the  <i> trackpad is not very responsive <i>  as a laptop trackpad.
1	I haven't yet used it within a suite like XBMC or Boxee, so it might be more effective if you were predominantly using arrows and not a mouse, but the  <i> trackpad is not very functional <i> .
1	this is a good little device BUT the  <i> track pad did not perform well <i>  and the range was less than 20ft if you were wanting it to go through a wall.
1	Cons The <i>  mouse pad is off to the right <i>  which I didn't like as much as the Adesso above which is in the center.
1	Im not about to write a dissertation with it, but short emails and web URLs are no issue + it works + the laser pointer is handy for messing with my dog + backlit display + the 4 way arrow button makes browsing the web easy(er) & partially saves the disappointing touchpad Not so Awesome: - goofy mouse button locations -  <i> touch pad isnt very responsive  <i> & cheap plastic feeling - remote needs a direct line of sight to the receiver.
1	if it weren't for this  <i> godawful touchpad feature  <i> (which can't be disabled!
1	This mini keyboard works well under linux, although the  <i> touch-pad is very sensitive <i> .
1	But now, the  <i> touchpad is sluggish  <i> and not all of the keys work.
1	Great idea, but this device continues to disconnect, and the  <i> touchpad is very unresponsive <i> .
1	While it's unresponsive at times and needs to be turned off and on again to make it work, and the  <i> trackpad won't work  <i> at all if your hands are dirty (and forget about it EVER recognizing trackpad taps), if you stick to it, you'll manage to navigate through your HTPC and get your movie started.
1	The position of the  <i> trackpad causes your right thumb to reach over <i>  too far and hurts (can't comfortably thumb type).
1	Worked great for the first day, now the  <i> trackpad only works about half the time <i> .
1	The first one I recieved had a  <i> defective mouse pad <i> .
1	The backlight on the keyboard is pretty awesome but I do find the <i>  touchpad to be unresponsive  <i> at times.
1	1) the tap on the  <i> touchpad is very sensitivee <i>  and there is no option to disableee or correct.
1	The <i>  touch pad is pretty bad <i>  and unresponsive.
1	It stated to be compatable but the touch  <i> pad does not work  <i> with Wii.
1	The  <i> trackpad however was the worst <i>  and is totally unusable.
1	the range on this is a complete joke 5ft max <i>  touch pad barely works  <i> i bought a Rii mini and its amazing works great dont buy this buy a Rii mini bluetooth!
1	The  <i> touchpad is sluggish <i>  but functional.
1	2) The  <i> trackpad isn't as sensitive <i>  as it should be.
1	The  <i> keypad is less responsive away <i>  from its center; until it tweaks or is completely stuck.
1	However, it's too small, and the  <i> trackpad just doesn't work well <i>  enough to warrant not getting off the couch to use my laptop's trackpad.
1	NO Bluetooth, and  <i> touchpad is very horrible <i> .
1	It's not even close to Chines  <i> fake laptop touchpad <i> !
1	While the headset was on,  <i> track pad usage on this product was non-existent <i>  and keyboard strokes registered 1/10th of the time.
1	The range isn't that great and the  <i> mousepad isn't really sensitive enough <i>  for fine adjustments.
1	the only gripe i have about is the  <i> touchpad, which does not work  <i> at all right out of the box.
1	The responsiveness of this keyboard is good if you are right next to the receiver, but the  <i> touchpad is not so responsive  <i> no matter where you are.
1	The trackpad is ok (can't compare to the Apple Magic Pad), but the buttons on the  <i> pad are a bit flimsy and definitely unreliable <i>  -- takes a really firm click to register.
1	Also the mouse  <i> pad is a little flakey <i> .
1	But the second one arrived from FAVI and it is poor quality - about 20% of the keypresses don't work, and the mouse  <i> pad isn't sensitive enough <i> .
1	The  <i> mousepad is not that great either <i> .
1	As for the key pad, let us start with the fact that the  <i> touch pad may get in the way of your right hand <i>  typing if you intend to type with you thumbs like you do on your cell phone.
1	Playing first-person shooters that require accurate aiming, however, could be problematic, as K400's  <i> touchpad simply isn't as precise <i>  as a more sophisticated gaming mouse, such as my Logitech G5.
1	My  <i> biggest gripe is with the touchpad <i> .
1	A great keyboard remote for HTPCs, but the  <i> trackpad is pretty mediocre <i> .
1	The touch  <i> pad works but is not sensitive  <i> enough to use your thumb making operation somewhat awkward.
1	Yes the key board works and the track pad but the <i>  track pad is super slow <i> .
1	Mouse  <i> pad is in a bad location <i> making it difficult to operate keys on the right side of the keyboard.
1	Mouse  <i> pad has delayed reaction  <i> and needs to be swiped several times to travel across screen.
1	The  <i> touchpad on this thing is unusable <i> , it's so out of control sensitive that even getting my hand or finger anywhere close to it (even on just the outside of the device on either the front or the back) cause the cursor to jump all over the place or begin clicking as it perceives more than one tap of the pad.
1	good quality overall , but an  <i> extremely sensitive touch pad  <i> along with sticky keys that will occasionally give a long line of the same letter, or scroll uncontrollably to the top or bottom of the page prevent me from giving it a top rating.
1	I do not have a light touch so I figure the  <i> pad might take some getting used to <i> , but some sort of adjustment like on a laptop pad would be useful.
1	There are almost 1/4" edges around the perimeter of the  <i> touchpad which makes it impossible to use <i>  the full touchpad.
1	However, its  <i> trackpad was slow  <i> and frustrating to use.
1	Touch <i>  pad was the worst <i>  I ever used.
1	The two-finger scrolling function on the  <i> touch pad leave a lot to be desired <i> .
1	For the size and layout, the keyboard and touchpad are easy enough to use, though the  <i> touchpad is a bit finicky <i>  at times.
1	The keypad is quirky, the  <i> mousepad is not responsive enough <i> , and overall it is just too frustrating.
1	PROs + Size is excellent, smaller than a typical tv remote + Keyboard is very compact but the keys are large enough to be usable + Touchpad is a key advantage of the design and is big enough to be usable + Mouse keys and arrow bottons are well placed, below the touchpad + Range is fine (some reviewers criticized range but I had no problems, see note below on line of sight) + Battery life is good CONs - Keys are poor quality and often stick or require multiple touches to register (sometimes you press a key once and have it fill the screen with the same character, other times you have to press the same key 4 or 5 times to get anything) -  <i> Touchpad often is not responsive <i>  (when it works it's great but often it doesn't and you have to turn it off and on again) - Appears to require line of sight connection with USB receiver.
1	-- the footprint of the  <i> touchpad surface is too small <i>  by half (the proportion of finger move to the proportion of space you cover is doubled) and the precision response is too erratic (i.
