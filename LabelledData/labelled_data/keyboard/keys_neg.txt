1	the same one I bought a few years ago: The  <i> keys are much louder  <i> on this one and also not as soft to the touch.
1	Just discovered this, that this keyboard's  <i> keys is prone to failure <i> .
1	And she bought a new one, same model, and that too,  <i> keys started failing <i> .
1	Of all things about a keyboard, if the  <i> keys start to fail <i> , it's the worst.
1	Was able to install anyways only to discover that several  <i> keys didn't work <i> .
1	Great little device, but a number of the normal keyboard  <i> keys are either missing  <i> or missing functionality.
1	The other problem I have with this keyboard is that the "J", "U", "H"  <i> keys sometimes do not work <i> .
1	I  <i> had to hit those keys harder  <i> to ensure those keys work.
1	As any new keyboard there's a learning curve and it takes a little time to get used to and find the keys, however I still today  <i> constantly miss keys  <i> nd though I really like some of the other functions am contemplating going back to the ugly cream coloured ergo board.
1	I'm giving this keyboard one star because ultimately a keyboard primarily  <i> needs to have keys that are comfortable for me  <i> to use and don't impede my input.
1	I found the keys on this keyboard to be way too "spongey", meaning that the  <i> keys press down quite a ways  <i> then don't spring right back up.
1	I found myself  <i> having to press the keys harder <i> , and that would then slow down the next key press.
1	I've owned three of these, and all have at least 2  <i> keys that don't work  <i> without having to bang hard on them.
1	If you spill any amount of liquid on this keyboard whatosoever, individual  <i> keys will stop responding  <i> within minutes and you'll need a replacement.
1	It works (connects easily and every time) and it's nice to have the laptop style trackpad built-in, unfortunately the  <i> keys are cramped  <i> for serious typing.
1	On my first one the left Ctrl key, the letter V, and the  <i> comma keys all died <i> .
1	First the  <i> keys went "soft"  <i> where they were visibly sunken down and felt less clicky & springy, and then one day they just no longer worked.
1	Things you should consider: Microsoft uses an "F-lock" key design, where the F  <i> keys along the top are not enabled  <i> until you hit the F-lock button.
1	Just plugging the receiver the keyboard started work right away, which is good, but not with full functionality: the grey function  <i> keys at the top are not functional <i> , and the mouse click wheel button is not functional.
1	The keyboard is much smaller (and as a result less ergonomic)  - they have managed to do this because the  <i> keys are smaller  <i> and placed closer together (especially the arrow keys!
1	the one i received did not have a sticker on the box and the  <i> keys were hard  <i> plastic.
1	The  <i> keys are very slippery  <i> and my fingers were constantly sliding off them.
1	And if you like to lower the lights while you're browsing the web, you'll be constantly holding the keyboard up to the light because the  <i> keys are not backlit <i> .
1	The other "extra"  <i> keys haven't gotten much use  <i> yet, but as I ramp up the keyboard's use for work -- and Excel -- I think I'll really like the extra numeric keypad keys (parens and equals).
1	Sadly, even the letter  <i> keys are also far too hard  <i> to depress.
1	but the  <i> keys get rubbed off  <i> during normal use after only a few months.
1	The touchpad is not functional and  <i> keys appear to stick  <i> or just don't respond at all.
1	Now I have 3 defective keyboards because some  <i> keys do not register  <i> (M, N, Caps are common).
1	Both Alt, both Ctrl, left Shift, and a whole lot of  <i> keys don't work <i> .
1	(with 10 days of vacation in the midst) and already four of the  <i> keys have the printing nearly worn off <i> .
1	However, I have had multiple times that groups of  <i> keys stop working  <i> or single keys will hang giving me a string of single key inputs.
1	Alternate  <i> on again, off again keys  <i> ZXCV and ENTER.
1	I now have the Adesso Tru-Form Media, on which the  <i> keys are slightly louder  <i> but since the sound is uniform you don't notice it once you get into the rhythm.
1	One clue is that the System Profiler claimed to be able to see the device when the USB dongle was plugged in even though the computer  <i> stopped responding to keystrokes  <i> or the touchpad.
1	They <i>  keys don't have a good feel <i> .
1	Certain  <i> keys became nonfunctional  <i> and the majority of the rest of the keys typed a letter or symbol other than what it was supposed to be.
1	I use the mouse as little as possible and  <i> not having the keys  <i> where I'm used to them is not a good thing.
1	3 days after purchasing this keyboard and a few of the <i>  keys stopped working properly <i> .
1	At first most of the  <i> keys were jumbled up <i> so whenever I would type something it was displayed wrong on my computer screen for instance if I hit the 6 button on the numeric keypad it would display.
1	I just wish the  <i> keys were a little easier to depress <i> .
1	Also, occasionally the Function key modifier would get stuck off and the Function  <i> keys would no longer work <i> .
1	I spilled a very small amount of coffee on this keyboard (probably less than a teaspoon) and several  <i> keys now fail to function <i> .
1	The second one was terrible, several  <i> keys are really sticky <i> --they don't bounce back right away, and the Space bar is the worst of them all.
1	UPDATE: After two months of using this keyboard, more  <i> keys stopped working <i> .
1	Like other users have said the  <i> keys are not very responsive <i>  especially the space bar.
1	Also is missing several function  <i> keys that make it hard  <i> to use keyboard shortcuts.
1	If you try one in store, that  <i> wiggle in the keys  <i> is not from buy-nothing kids repeatedly pounding on it with their fists for months.
1	This however blocks the internal antenna and  <i> cause keystrokes to be missed <i> .
1	The reason I would like to give it negative stars is that the printing on the  <i> keys is disappearing  <i> with less than 6 months of use.
1	Just for comparison's sake, I have a very standard beige keyboard that has  <i> keys in almost as bad a condition  <i> as this one.
1	The design is good but the feel of the  <i> keys is poor <i> .
1	Additionally, some  <i> keys are easier to depress  <i> than others which interferes with typing.
1	However, sometime I have to make an extra effort to  <i> punch the keys  <i> for the letter to show up on the screen and the location of the right-side shift key is "off" from the full-sized keyboard, which leaves me pressing the page up key a lot.
1	However, there's one glaring flaw that isn't apparent until you've used the keyboard full time for 2-3 years: The letters/symbols on the  <i> keys wear off over time <i> .
1	This IS a problem because you'll be filling out a long form or doing extensive work in a browser and all of a sudden you'll go back a page and lose the data when you barely miss the spacebar and  <i> hit one of those keys  <i> instead.
1	Without having spilled liquids in the keyboard, getting it full of food crumbs, or physically damaging it, I've noticed that some  <i> keys stick <i> .
1	If I try relaxing, I often  <i> press keys in the wrong order  <i> or miss them.
1	It's useless when  <i> keys stop working <i> , and really annoying when one moment it was working fine and in the middle of your email, the "C" key stops working or the right shift stops working.
1	The  <i> keys have quite a mushy feel <i> ; definitely not a good choice for heavy duty writers or coders.
1	THe Bad:  The  <i> keys are too small <i> , touchad is on right side of keyboard.
1	These keyboards suffer from poor quality (made in China like everything else these days) and I've got a stack of bad ones sitting beside me that have to be thrown out due to  <i> non-functioning keys <i> .
1	It is fine except to one thing - after writing one book with it the E, D, S, and C  <i> keys are nearly blank <i> .
1	The  <i> keys don't have the tactile feedback  <i> of even the basic free keyboard bundled with new computers.
1	All the other  <i> keys are soft  <i> and take little effort to strike.
1	cons: - The  <i> keys are quieter  <i> on this model, but slightly harder to depress causing a minor slow down.
1	- Compared to other Ergonomic keyboards, one has to note that unless the  <i> keys are physically separated  <i> into two groups any ergonomic effects will be minimal.
1	- The Media  <i> keys on top do not sit well <i>  in their homings and are not perfectly aligned.
1	- the  <i> rows of keys are FLAT <i>  - - - you must prop your wrists up high - - - - so you don't hit the key below the one you want - - - - BUT adding a wrist rest hides the LED's for caplock, etc - - - - - and blocks the back & forward buttons - the cord exits right on the edge - - don't let it land on edge - the cord will be severely bent - - - I lost a Natural MM KB with a cord like this - - - - (Natural Pro recessed the cord exit, no risk of bent cord).
1	It has a nice wrist cushion, but overall, the feel of the keys, the unwieldy over-sized footprint, and  <i> flimsy keys  <i> don't add up to a very good typing experience.
1	It never worked again; most of the  <i> keys did not work <i> .
1	It's not a bad keyboard, but I've been using it for work for about a year and the first think that annoys me is that the letters on the  <i> keys wear off <i> .
1	On this keyboard it's easy to  <i> type multiple keys  <i> on accident (I find it happens more often with passwords) due to the sloppy feel of the keyboard.
1	Add this to the fact that the  <i> keys feel "squishy"  <i> and you've got one crazy typing experience.
1	I really did try to get use to this, but I kept finding myself  <i> pressing incorrect keys <i> , or having to look at the keyboard to make sure I hit the right key.
1	Cons: - The tiny plastic feet are useless - Some letters on keyboard are larger than others (annoying) -  <i> Keys feel way too soft <i>  and offer no feedback - Missing extra media controls While this keyboard may be "comfortable" and looks nice, it's just not practical for daily use if the feet break, the  <i> keys feel strange <i> , and it slows down your typing experience.
1	The  <i> spacing of the keys on this keyboard seems too large <i>  (?
1	The  <i> keys are loud <i> .
1	The first one lasted 3 years, before several  <i> keys started refusing to respond <i> --even with extra pressure.
1	Its size is a bit larger than I'm accustomed to, the  <i> keys do not accept double letters <i>  and make me hit the same key three to four times to get two f's or two l'l or two anything, and the spacebar has to be hammered to work, but all in all, things were working out.
1	Granted, most people won't need them, but if you're a programmer, then having arrow  <i> keys chopped in half  <i> and shoved into a non-standard configuration is a major shortcoming.
1	The "T" and "G"  <i> keys are consistently larger  <i> than the elite (The elite T&G keys are technically the same size as the 4000 series, but are raised in such a way that typists may need to get used to the new feel of these keys).
1	This popular keyboard is famous for having  <i> keys suddenly stop working <i> , work intermittently or different keys work at intermittent times.
1	In summary: Pro: Ergonomics are good Typewriter keys and numeric keypad are fine Con: arrow keys and navigation keys are too small and in a non-standard position keyboard is wobbly and little flimsy  <i> keys are a little mushy  <i> when pressed.
1	The  <i> keys are very hard to press <i>  - within 1 minute of typing, I am already feeling cramps in my hands.
1	0 (certain  <i> keys would not work properly <i> ) and the keyboard feels cheap.
1	The Ergo 4000 has  <i> keys that don't feel nearly as good <i>  as those from older keyboards - this being my major reason why I won't buy this keyboard (I would have otherwise).
1	They feel like cheap plastic (some  <i> keys are harder to hit  <i> and some are so light after a while that they get activated as soon as they are gently touched).
1	The first thing I tried it, I immediately realized that I  <i> need a very hard press on keys <i> .
1	After about 2 weeks to 1 month, the  <i> keys start becoming louder <i> , less smooth, while still functional.
1	I find that the  <i> keys feel, well, soft to me <i> , for lack of a better word.
1	The <i>  keys lack a responsive crispness <i>  that better keyboards have.
1	And I found that the  <i> angle of the keys  <i> meant my elbows had to be kept at an uncomfortably wide angle, causing instant discomfort in my shoulder muscles.
1	The 'H' key didn't work and two other  <i> keys were very sticky <i> , making a really annoying loud clicking sound each time I hit them.
1	The  <i> keys are soft <i> .
1	This keyboard only lasted 4 months and then random  <i> keys stopped working <i> .
1	The simultaneous pressing of 3 or 4  <i> keys causes some sort of lock-up <i>  and your keyboard will send a constant signal of movement, even though you've lifted your hands off the keyboard.
1	(Mine showed up with three  <i> keys dislodged <i> , and didn't function after careful set up--no number lock/caps lock lights to suggest it was responding to either of my up-to-date computers.
1	After only a few days of use, the spacebar stopped working, and the number  <i> keys were either broken <i>  or typing strange combinations.
1	The action of the  <i> keys are stiff <i> , and what is worse: noisy.
1	The  <i> keys could be slightly smaller <i> .
1	With this keyboard you can program those keys like that now but the fact that they stick and are not real  <i> keys make that useless <i> .
1	It seems obvious that a lot of people are having certain  <i> keys conk out  <i> at some point.
1	The problem lies when you have to  <i> reach for the keys <i>  (that are hard to reach even on a regular keyboard) such as the 1,2,0,-,+,and BACKSPACE keys.
1	If you have above average length fingers this may not be a problem but if you have average to below-average length fingers/hands there is definitely a problem due to the fact that these  <i> keys slope downward  <i> away from the reach of your hands in addition to the regular reach you have on a non-ergonomic keyboard.
1	Those  <i> keys are in a different zip-code  <i> on this keyboard.
1	The downward slope feels great with the regular keys but constant reaching for the 1,2,0,-,+, and BACKSPACE  <i> keys will cause pain <i>  rapidly.
1	If they would have made those keys closer or not had those  <i> keys slope down  <i> and away from your hands it might be OK.
1	Or if they made the keys near them smaller to  <i> make these keys a little closer <i> .
1	Or if they made one with  <i> smaller keys <i> , or keys not so far apart, or out of reach due to the downward slope of the keyboard.
1	I hope this review helps and gives incentive to the majority of us without large hands/fingers to test it in a computer store/electronics store first to see how well your fingers can reach some of those out of  <i> out-of reach keys <i> .
1	Unfortunately, after a few months using the keyboard, some of the  <i> keys stopped working  <i> properly.
1	Other reviewers have had similar  <i> problems with other keys <i> .
1	All the extra  <i> keys just sit there <i> , I haven't trained myself to use them.
1	The second is that the volume  <i> keys don't work  <i> unless you have clicked on the volume icon in the taskbar first, which kind of defeats the purpose of having the keys in the first place.
1	It is a little difficult to use due to it's non standard layout, the  <i> keys feel a little mushy  <i> and the overall construction is a little flimsy.
1	I also found it  <i> hard to see the keys  <i> in a dimly lit room even with the back light on.
1	This is the only keyboard I have ever had where  <i> keys routinely cease to respond <i> .
1	I bought this keyboard once, experienced the  <i> malfunctioning keys  <i> and decided to bright the "faulty" keyboard home to use with my laptop and buy a new one for work.
1	I had owned one of these keyboards a few years ago and the  <i> keys started going bad <i> .
1	Most of the time keystrokes get throught with no problem, but for no obvious reason, the keyboard occasionally locks up and  <i> keystrokes aren't registered <i> .
1	Got the perfect touchpad sensitivity in the first shipment, but there was  <i> something wrong with one of the keys <i> .
1	The board & mouse have a great feel and are very responsive, until the  <i> keys stop working <i> .
1	At first my  <i> keys stop registering <i>  and I would have to push really hard on them to input, I thought a change of batteries would fix the problem.
1	Eventually, most of the  <i> keys completely stopped working <i>  right after the warrenty ran out,of course.
1	So next I opted for this, the even cheaper 2000 keyboard only, as the mouse that came with the 3000 still works great, and sure enough, the  <i> keys started to become unresponsive  <i> after a few months!
1	I've had one Comfort Curve 4000 and two 2000s and all of them have failed --- some of the  <i> keys become unresponsive <i> .
1	However, it uses a non-standard layout for the home, end, and delete  <i> keys which can be difficult  <i> to get used to.
1	The arrow-directional  <i> keys are not in the standard position <i> , or like they are on other Microsoft natural Keyboards, which is odd.
1	But even though they keyboard was not being used that often, the same issue reoccurred a few months later and two other  <i> keys would no longer type <i> .
1	The other  <i> keys are also a bit too stiff <i> .
1	A lot of people have commented on the function keys but the exact working of these convenience  <i> keys is a minor issue <i>  for me.
1	Anyway, this product does what I bought it to do, but looking at those  <i> dead shortcut keys  <i> all the time bums me out.
1	Other  <i> keys also got sticky  <i> after a few weeks of use.
1	The spacebar has  <i> more resistance than the other keys  <i> and that is not pleasant.
1	The keys are quiet but the  <i> depression of the keys are a little bit harder  <i> than the previous models.
1	The thing I hate the most is when you're typing and the  <i> keys are hard to press <i>  or you have to hit the keys at a certain angle in order for it to go down and register.
1	This 4000 model, the keys are soft yet you have to hit the  <i> keys a little bit harder <i>  for it to go down.
1	I just cannot stand typing on keyboards that have  <i> keys that are hard to press <i> .
1	The design is nice but the  <i> keys are hard to press  <i> which mean you have to hit the keys that much more harder.
1	I had to replace the first one because I spilled something on it and after that it would type  <i> incorrect letters for the keys struck <i> .
1	I bought this to replace my original generation natural keyboard which I had for seven years at work before one of the  <i> keys stopped functioning <i> .
1	The key layout in the positioning of the keys is good and the feel of the keys is nice, and I do like the ergonomically design to keyboards, but for the combination of the  <i> keys being lower in the center <i>  and the flat design, we will be looking to get a different one.
1	It's a nice enough keyboard and mouse, but it has a terrible time with  <i> dropped keystrokes <i>  and multi-second keystroke lag.
1	The  <i> keystrokes start lagging <i>  and the cursor action is very choppy around only 5' away.
1	Overall it works well but some of the  <i> keys have a very loose, cheap feeling <i> .
1	Even when connected the connection was spotty from any more than 5 feet away and  <i> keystrokes were not recognized  <i> most of the time.
1	but this is not the key board for you if you are used to  <i> finding keys by instinct <i> .
1	some  <i> keys are not where they ought to be <i>  (or at least not where people are generally used to finding them intuitively--shift key for example), located in wrong places and in wrong (meaning, disproportionate) sizes and shapes.
1	a)  <i> keys get stuck <i>  b) range is at most 2 feet, not *up to 100* feet as advertized on the box.
1	Limited range and  <i> stuck keys  <i> makes it useless for HTPC.
1	 <i> Same keys failed <i> , in about a month.
1	It is difficult to pick the device up without  <i> pressing keys <i> .
1	 <i> Some keys are sensitive <i>  while others need breaking into.
1	The  <i> keys are grid shaped <i> , not offset like a normal keyboard and because of the touch pad on the right it's not as easy to type on as say an Iphone because you'r right thumb has to reach considerably further to hit any of the keys.
1	Sitting about 10 ft away from the computer I found that it  <i> drops keystrokes <i>  about every 5th input.
1	Also, these  <i> keys are now half-sized <i> , and therefore harder to hit.
1	All the  <i> keys are designed very cheaply  <i> and will not take a great deal of repeated use, especially if you are heavy handed.
1	Comparing with my previous one, which is also logitech, the  <i> keys in this keyboard are a bit small <i>  and harder to hit.
1	I already discarded one and replaced it due to  <i> failing keys <i> .
1	I've had about 3 so far, and some have had  <i> failed keys  <i> (the ALT key sometimes is difficult to press).
1	I agree with the other negative reviews regarding the smaller size and changed arrangement of the Insert/Home keys, and the smaller  <i> squished-together arrow keys <i> .
1	Typing can be quite a chore, you will be typing along and then certain <i>  keys just don't respond <i> , not always the same key and quite sporadic to which one(s) it chooses.
1	The keyboard is so light/flimsy and the  <i> keys are clunky feeling <i> .
1	This keyboard is horrible for people with repetitive stress injuries because the  <i> keys are so hard to depress <i> .
1	I'm not sure what the manufacturer was thinking (maybe harder to push  <i> keys give the illusion of sturdiness <i> ) but it is irritating for wrists that are already prone to inflammation.
1	I agree with the other negative reviews regarding the smaller size and changed arrangement of the Insert/Home keys, and the smaller  <i> squished-together arrow keys <i> .
1	The  <i> keys themselves are hard plastic <i>  but they feel mushy when pressed.
1	The  <i> keys are glossy and hard <i> , compared to what is shown here.
1	Regardless, the  <i> keys are very difficult to type  <i> on compared to the T-Mobile G2 keyboard that I'm used using on a daily basis.
1	It also take a while to  <i> get use to the smaller keys <i>  like the shift and the backspace.
1	it worked great for a while but then the  <i> keys stopped working <i>  for some reason, however the keyboard is very comfortable to use, just don't save up your money for this.
1	I bought this keyboard just a week ago, thinking that what the other reviewers were saying about the  <i> keys being too hard to press <i>  was an exageration.
1	this one feels kind of weird as if he  <i> keys are kind of sharp <i> .
1	I have been using older microsoft ergo keyboards for years without issues, but these ones seem to have a few issues the buyer should be aware of: *The lettering on the  <i> keys WILL wear off <i>  and do so FAST.
1	*The larger  <i> keys tend to lose their ability <i>  to stay properly centered.
1	This causes  <i> keys that feel wobbly  <i> and rock side to side slightly, and it can be quite annoying.
1	The  <i> keys are very noisy <i> .
1	Also, I have to  <i> push very hard the keys <i>  and that causes me tired hands, especially the space bar key.
1	The status lights don't work - The drag and drop won't work - the auto shutoff for the backlighting does not work - the range is 3 feet up to 9 if I place the dongle and hold the keyboard just right - the backlighting is uneven behind the keys -  <i> not all keys make good contact <i>  - and those are just preliminary observations - the inept lack of ergonomics makes it seem like it was built by a committee of hair-brained wannabe sub-nerds - I took the chance and lost.
1	The spacebar is half-responsive, and the tiny little function, arrow and page  <i> keys are a nightmare <i> .
1	Unfortunately, both in the past few weeks have started to  <i> "lose" keys  <i> or require that they be pressed for an inordinate amount of time to actually communicate with the controller in the keyboard to recognize :-/.
1	I was deceived by its stylish look, and when I started using it, immediately I found that the cursor keys and the page up/down, home/end  <i> keys are so awkwardly placed <i> , making the keyboard virtually useless in OS where you absolutely need those keys -- like Windows.
1	In the past, I even tried painting clear nail  <i> polish on the keys to protect them <i> , but that didn't help much.
1	The  <i> keys are very slick <i>  and my fingers slid all over the keyboard.
1	Not only that, they keys for the <i>  arrow keys are smaller <i>  - maybe only 75% of the size of the other keys.
1	Unless the quality of the contact points for the m and i  <i> keys is just abysmal <i> , I have to stab both hard to get them to work, even with the keyboard new.
1	you actually need to type a document using this and u will know why the  <i> keys make it hard to type <i> .
1	and reduce  <i> size of most keys <i> .
1	Oh and I didn't notice it at first but mine is  <i> missing an O key <i> , I have 2 P keys though so if anyone has my O and would like their P back I'm willing to make a trade.
1	The arrows  <i> keys are nearly impossible to use <i> , especially for gaming.
1	The keyboard is not staggered as a typical keyboard--this presented some problems that I could never quite adjust to, and the Control, Escape and Return  <i> keys are all moved in odd positions <i> .
1	As has been stated, the spacebar is  <i> harder to push than other keys  <i> and significantly louder.
1	But I don't understand why the  <i> keys have to be smaller <i> .
1	I can live with cheap feel of the keyboard but not  <i> different spacing for keys <i> .
1	Typing on the  <i> keys feels a little awkward  <i> at first due to the vertical layout of the letters, although it get's easier to use with practice.
1	But the  <i> keys are sort of sticky  <i> because of the way it is shaped and the placement of your hands.
1	The the  <i> keys do feel a little "mushy"  <i> without the tactile feedback of some of the better boards, such as those from IBM.
1	My biggest complaint is that the letters  <i> easily wear off the keys <i> .
1	The  <i> keys were very stiff <i> .
1	I spend a great deal of time using a keyboard, and I have to have one that is responsive all the time, not one that requires me to  <i> beat on the keys  <i> to get them to work properly.
1	It has been the space bar mostly, but other  <i> keys also suffer <i>  the same problem.
1	This keyboard was terrific for me until the E and L  <i> keys stopped working <i>  55 days after I purchased it.
1	I do think it's a generally better layout than the previous versions of Microsoft ergonomic keyboards I've cycled through, but some of my  <i> keys started sticking <i>  recently, and about half the letters are worn off - the keys I'm obviously hitting most often.
1	The  <i> keystroke doesn't register <i>  if I don't hit at exactly the right angle on about 5 or 6 keys, and for these tired hands, after 8 or 10 hours at the glo box, I don't find the touch soft enough, even though I've read it described as soft.
1	And sometimes double keystrokes and  <i> missing keystrokes  <i> no matter how hard I tried to cleanly press the keys.
1	They <i>  keys are incredibly hard to press <i> , and the spacebar is noisy and stiff.
1	The  <i> keys are a little stiffer  <i> to press down but once I get flying, they fly too with ease.
1	However, the  <i> keys were a bit too small <i>  for me to comfortably type on.
1	Many of my  <i> keys have stopped working <i> .
1	I loved the design of this keyboard and have enjoyed using it, but some of the  <i> keys have quit working <i>  for no apparent reason.
1	The  <i> keys are also a bit stiff <i> .
1	After about an hour of pretty steady typing, the  <i> keys got noticeably noisier <i>  until when I removed it from service it was hard to tell the difference between it and the others in our office.
1	The biggest problem is that the space bar has way too much resistance--far more than the other keys-- although I think all the  <i> keys offer a bit more resistance <i>  than I'm used to.
1	I felt like I had to  <i> reach excessively for some keys <i> , like "y," "control," and "enter".
1	Cons: --Finger placement detection (ridge on F and J  <i> keys) is insufficient <i> .
1	--Letters  <i> rub off the keys very quickly  <i> and no replacements are available --Occasionally keys are difficult to press --The keyboard is relatively large Pros:  It is very quiet, most keys are easy to press.
1	Also the  <i> keys are not the most responsive  <i> and are not sensitive.
1	this was a comfortable keyboard to use until the membrane key backings  <i> failed on one of the keys <i> .
1	The  <i> keys are weird <i>  and make typing for a long time a hassle.
1	Some  <i> keys are bigger  <i> than others!
1	Some of the  <i> keys on the keyboard did not work properly <i>  and required multiple hits to register.
1	While the keyboard 100% works (and the extra functions do also), I really dislike that pushing down on the  <i> keys doesn't give you the response <i>  that some of the other better MS keyboards do also.
1	The hand position feels just right, but depressing the  <i> keys is noisy  <i> and unpleasant.
1	Certain  <i> keys on the one I own stopped working  <i> after less than a month of light use.
1	I managed to take it apart and get the <i> bad keys working <i> , but who knows how often that will be necessary.
1	After using a Logitech Ergonomic keyboard and  <i> wearing out many keys <i>  (I work as a medical transcriptionist), I wanted to try the divided keyboard and go a little less expensive than the model of Logitech I had.
1	 <i> Loud keys are a serious issue <i> , but I sent this back and exchanged it because of issues with the spacebar.
1	My previous one lasted two years before  <i> keys mysteriously died <i>  -- not great longevity, but acceptable.
1	Today multiple  <i> keys on the right side just died on me <i> , seemingly out of nowhere.
1	I liked having the shortcut keys that reduced the amount of mousing I had to do, but the spacebar was hard to press and the  <i> keys felt a little gummy <i> .
1	The curved keyboard with  <i> keys at different heights <i>  is a pain in the butt.
1	Typing  is quite difficult with the  <i> keys at various heights  <i> it actually slows me down.
1	Every one of the previous keybords had the  <i> keys fade to the point  <i> of not being able to determine what the key was.
1	Pros: -Ergonomic layout -It works (for now) Cons: -Tilt and Spacebar key were popped out on arrival (Don't think I was the only one with this experience) -Stiff Keys -Feels cheap - <i> Fuction keys are too small <i>  Comments: What is up with microsoft's quality control?
1	The board and  <i> keys feel real cheap <i> , I don't even think this keyboard will last 2 years.
1	The  <i> keys on this board aren't spaced out <i>  enough, and they also feel real stiff.
1	The  <i> key is bigger too than normal keys  <i> which magnifies the problem.
1	The mouse is way to small to be comfortable and the  <i> keys on the keyboard are pretty loose <i> .
1	The other  <i> keys felt tight <i>  as well.
1	However, the  <i> keys were sticky and noisy <i> , and the spacebar stuck about every fifth time it was struck.
1	The  <i> keys were too stiff <i> ; I don't remember any keyboards that required break-in periods.
1	The  <i> keys have to be pressed harder <i>  than most keyboards, so I do find my fingers a little more tired than normal.
1	The  <i> keys are stiff <i> , and the spacebar is agonizingly stiff.
1	While I am enjoying some of the features of my new keyboard, such as the programmable buttons, I am still finding it  <i> difficult to type due to the placement of the keys <i> .
1	The worst problem I am having is with the  <i> hard touch of the keys <i> , especially the space bar.
1	The white lettering on the  <i> keys has come off <i>  and now most of the keys are just blank (luckily I know where keys are without looking down).
1	The keyboard is noisy, the  <i> keys are not as soft or quiet <i> .
1	The arrow  <i> keys are unusually small <i> , and the arrangement is weired.
1	The keyboard  <i> keys are a little noisy  <i> which in my case I like.
1	I have also experienced  intermittent problems with several  <i> keys not registering  <i> regardless of strike force; a problem that up to now has resolved itself inexplicably.
1	I'm having a lot of difficulty striking the "x" and the outside  <i> keys that require the pinky finger <i>  (hand size issue?
1	big keys like space bar and shift  <i> keys are not pressed as smoothly  <i> as others 2.
1	functional keys like custom  <i> keys are not lit  <i> that it is difficult to see & software takes is a resource hog.
1	As for the keyboard itself, I tend to like my keys to have a 'springy' feel to them, but these  <i> keys are very soft <i> .
1	WHile it does keep your wrists straight, the  <i> keys are EXTREMELY SOFT TOUCH <i> .
1	It is too easy to hit multiple keys, and the force needed to press the space bar and some of the  <i> keys is unnatural <i> .
1	This black 4000 board is okay but it has a  <i> lot of unneeded keys <i>  - no big deal.
1	The extra  <i> keys didn't work <i>  on the first MS keyboard I purchased.
1	The  <i> keys are clunky <i> , and you practically have to pound on them.
1	Like so many others, some of my  <i> keys died  <i> after a year or two.
1	But after 6 months or so several  <i> keys stopped working <i>  (colon/semicolon + some keypad keys) despite only light use and no spills.
1	Apparently I'm far from the only one experiencing  <i> failed keys <i> .
1	Several  <i> keys suddenly stopped working <i> .
1	I also found that the  <i> keys were not as comfortable <i>  to hit over time as I had hoped.
1	The  <i> keys don't have any feedback <i> , and there are some more and less sensitive keys.
1	For those that are touch typists, the feel of the keyboard is spongy, rather than springy, and the  <i> keys have quite a long travel <i> .
1	Each  <i> keystroke requires a firm press <i> , and the "snap-over" is poorly defined.
1	But now, the touchpad is sluggish and  <i> not all of the keys work <i> .
1	None of the keys is exactly where I expect it to be, and the  <i> sizes of the keys are uneven <i> .
1	Found out certain  <i> keys were not registering <i> .
1	When typing, sometimes the  <i> keys stick <i>  and enter two or three times, other times they fail to respond at all.
1	If there are typos in this message, it is ecause some of the  <i> keys on this very keyoard are dead <i>  now.
1	I'm a two fingered typist na the ergo design is too big and the hump in the middle  <i> spreads the keys out too much <i>  and slows my type of typing down,  pluss the hump in the middle causes you to need light on two sides of the keyboard light on only one side causes shadows on the opposite side, if your a visual typist like me you  <i> lose sight of half the keys  <i> in a dimly lit room.
1	Certain  <i> keys quit working <i> and had to break out the old keyboard.
1	The arrow  <i> keys are way too small <i>  and have non-standard placement.
1	The function keys and the home, end, pageup, pagedown  <i> keys are also much smaller <i> .
1	I find it extremely  <i> difficult to use these keys <i> .
1	Unfortunately it isn't very bright and many of the  <i> keys aren't really lit up <i>  at all.
1	Depressing all other  <i> keys takes more pressure <i>  than I'm accustomed to using.
1	The distance between keys and the size of some  <i> keys is different <i>  than the Elite.
1	The  <i> keys are too difficult to press <i>  and the space bar is essentially unusable.
1	The curve of the  <i> keys is extremely minor <i> , so much so that it feels (on the wrists and hands) almost exactly like a standard keyboard.
1	- The <i> printing etc on the keys is also VERY bad <i> .
1	unfortunately, i'm going to return it to the store primarily because the  <i> keys are just too hard  <i> to push -- especially the spacebar.
1	( very smoth transaction no hassle) I am pleased with the performance but the  <i> keys are a bit sticky <i>  and the mouse is very touchy, but i understand that the keyboard will loosen up over time.
1	I started using it and two  <i> keys went dead  <i> after less than 6 months of light use.
1	A few  <i> keys were loose  <i> in the box when I got it, and I had to reconnect them manually.
1	The  <i> keys were tight <i> , with no play.
1	Even after it dried out, most of the  <i> keys either didn't work <i> , or generated seemingly random keypresses.
1	Some of the  <i> keys stopped working <i>  because it was humid.
1	The keyboard has a bad problem with missing keystrokes and with  <i> stuck keys <i> .
1	Several  <i> keys are difficult to type <i> , such as!
1	This was the second keyboard and some of the  <i> keys did not work <i> .
1	- Finally, I liked the placement of an extra set of EQUAL, PARENTHESIS and BACKSPACE at the top right corner (especially the parenthesis, I always hated finding the opening and closing one among the numbers) Now, THE BAD: - For some reason the ENTER and RIGHT SHIFT  <i> keys are too small <i> !
1	I also must have missed the part about the center of the keyboard being raised and the shape and placement of the  <i> keys really bothered my right hand/wrist <i>  - so I am sending it back.
1	This is a great keyboard, but the painted on letters on the  <i> keys are not durable <i>  and will soon rub off.
1	Generally, it is the way the keyboard is grounded internally, which causes certain  <i> keys to not function <i>  after time.
1	My two  <i> faulty keys <i> work now, but for how long?
1	The laser pointer never worked from day one and the keyboard  <i> keys was sluggish <i>  and would then jump with multiple entries for the same key.
1	On Monday, I came to work and found that some of my keyboard's  <i> keys had become sticky <i> , as if something had been spilled on them.
1	Some  <i> keys are too large  <i> and others are too small, and everything about this keyboard seems to be geared towards making the product look pretty.
1	For someone like me, who does a lot of technical work, the fact that the control <i>  keys are mushed  <i> to be super tiny is a big problem.
1	The problem is that after a few months some <i>  keys started to have problems <i> , I have to hit them harder than normal to type.
1	The keyboard came with dirt inside the keys, one of the back risers was broke, and two  <i> keys had the letters worn off <i> .
1	It has short periods of a few minutes where it works fine but then a few minutes after a movie starts, it will go back to  <i> sending random keys  <i> and functions to the PC throwing it into chaos.
1	one day my cat walked on top of the keyboard and one of my <i>  keys just popped out  <i> of the socket permanently, not recommended, and going back to the elite keyboard.
1	However, the  <i> keys themselves are much too firm <i> !
1	this morning, after a routine cleaning, the enter key, both <i>  shift keys and the question mark key stopped working <i> .
1	I use the keyboard primarily for writing, so I don't pay much attention to the other keys or their position; although, I think some of the  <i> keys are a little too small <i> .
1	The   <i> keys in general  are lousy <i> .
1	Second, the ergonomic design of the keyboard was quite pleasant, but the spacing and the  <i> sizing of the keys  <i> (some letter keys are larger than others) made typing a bit difficult; larger hands may find it a bit easier going.
1	But i didn't notice before purchasing that the Home/End/Delete and arrows  <i> keys are smaller  <i> than normal size.
1	on paper the promising features are: - extremly low form factor - 30 meters range - backlit - rechargable All sounds great but here's my findings after 1 week of trying to make it work: - quite ridicilous effective range - won't work correctly from within 10ft - 50% of keys type are not being transmitted, you end up typing everything twice -  <i> stuck keys <i>  - electronically not physically Overall nice try, but no cigar.
1	There are several issues I have with this keyboard: *  <i> Keys don't have that nice soft feeling <i>  when you press them like other keyboards (including a previous Microsoft  model) have - very clunky feeling * Spacebar feels small and hard to hit for touch typing (programmer) * the arrow keys and home/end/page up/down keys are in an unusual orientation so now I have to go look and find the appropriate key where before I could naturally hit the right key without looking.
1	The  <i> keys are a bit stiff <i> , resulting in occasional typos due to the key-press not registering.
1	This Microsoft keyboard has  <i> heavy keys <i> , requiring more force per stroke than I am used to.
1	I originally got this keyboard to help with my wrist problem, but because of the  <i> heavy keys <i>  I'm forced to type with harder and more deliberate action than my normal typing style.
1	First off, I did give this some time to adapt to (around 1 week) and it is not the positioning that I have an issue with, it is the tactile  <i> feedback of the keys <i> .
1	I am not expecting mechanical keyboard feedback, but these keys are some of the  <i> hardest keys to press down <i>  for a membrane keyboard.
1	This defeats half the purpose of an ergonomic keyboard if you have to strain constantly just to  <i> press down the keys <i> .
1	I would rather type on a better feedback experience (mechanical classic layout) than an ergonomic with the  <i> stiffest keys  <i> of any keyboard I have ever used.
1	The  <i> keys do not spring back <i>  very well and the net result is that typing is not as comfortable as it could be.
1	In only about 6 months the paint on the  <i> keys are worn off badly <i> .
1	It simply had several  <i> keys quit working <i> .
1	The other  <i> keys feel muddy <i>  if you will, no real good feedback, and sticks a lot due to the angle your hands rest.
1	Pretty good keyboard only complaints are some of the  <i> keys need a hard press <i>  to function.
1	However, the keyboard feels too large, and I often find myself  <i> stretching to press the keys <i> .
1	For styling reasons the bottom row of  <i> keys become progressively smaller  <i> toward the right side in order to visually align with the arrow keys and number pad.
1	I have used mine (an older version, of course) for over ten years, despite its  <i> worthless function keys <i> , because it is the only keyboard I can find that lets me type as much as I want without causing my wrists to hurt.
1	What I simply could not accept was how  <i> sticky the keys <i>  are.
1	The top row of  <i> keys makes NO sense <i> .
1	Sorry, but the keyboard is just too cramped and the unusual position of Shift and arrow  <i> keys makes me screw up  <i> pretty much every time I am trying to type a question mark.
1	I purchased this keyboard a little over 3 months ago and already the  <i> letters are coming off the keys  <i> and the spacebar sticks.
1	I was replacing a similar keyboard where the  <i> letters had worn off the keys <i> .
1	Also, maybe it's because I've been using laptops too long, but I really have to  <i> pound on the keys <i> , which, for me at least, kind of defeats the purpose of an ergonomic keyboard.
1	The  <i> keys are much harder to depress  <i> than most of the keyboards out there.
1	The  <i> keys are much stiffer  <i> than the generic Microsoft ergonomic Natural Keyboard elite.
1	Love the layout and feels better, however certain  <i> keys require a lot of force to press <i> , such as the space bar (right side requires a lot of force).
1	I would have appreciated knowing that some  <i> keys get stuck  <i> as I would have purchased a different item.
1	I also read that the lettering on the  <i> keys wears off  <i> after a short time.
1	Often if I am blocking the left corner of the remote I will cause  <i> keys to be skipped <i>  while typing.
1	The  <i> keys are not responsive <i> , the mouse sensitivity is awful and the craftsmanship is shoddy at best.
1	Trying to use this without being jolted out of what one is typing to look at the  <i> keys is virtually impossible <i>  because of that awkward split.
1	As mentioned in other reviews, the  <i> keys are hard to press  <i> with the space bar being the worst.
1	While the layout and features of this keyboard are great, the  <i> keys are terrible <i> .
1	Mine worked great for about a month, then random  <i> keys stopped working <i> , and no amount of cleaning or tinkering would bring them back.
1	Cons - Keyboard has been reduced in size so much that the PageUp, PageDown, Home and End  <i> keys require also pressing a function <i>  key at the same time which is awkward and annoying.
1	But the  <i> keys simply don't exist <i>  even though there is so much empty space on the keyboard.
1	The  <i> keys are shallow  <i> and do not provide good feedback.
1	* The third one (bought perhaps 6 months ago for my office) has an entire area of the keyboard (letters y,u,h,j,k,n,m) that is only very faintly responsive, so that you have to  <i> bang those keys hard  <i> to get the letters to type.
1	After rectifying this and plugging the keyboard in, I found that both shift keys, the return and enter keys, several of the F keys and the media  <i> keys (I stopped testing at this point), did not work at all <i> .
1	But my newest replacement has a  <i> mushy feel to the keys <i> --no life in them.
1	As stated in other 1 star ratings before, various  <i> keys have stopped working <i>  on my microsoft keyboard and it's well under a year since I brought it.
1	Some of the keys have a little  <i> too much spring in the keys <i> .
1	meaning that they  <i> keys can be difficult to push down <i> .
1	But the  <i> keys just don't have a nice response <i>  and feel very flimsy.
1	My biggest issue with the keyboard is that the spacing of the  <i> keys is too far apart <i> .
1	The  <i> keys are not as "soft"  <i> as my previous Microsoft Natural Elite for CTX.
1	The other  <i> keys seem pretty flimsy <i>  too.
1	So many of the interesting models of ergonomic keyboards re-arrange the "Insert", "Delete", "End", etc  <i> keys that it makes the keyboard awkward <i> .
1	Another common mistake is the keyboard vendors  <i> ake the arrow keys awkward <i>  by moving the left and right arrow keys upward so that they are not aligned with the down arrow key as seen on the common standard.
1	However there is an F lock key that should be checked, and is normal, but this simply isn't the case as the  <i> keys simply do not work <i> .
1	Many KVM vendors will tell you that if you can not control your computer past POST and before boot, it is because the  <i> keyboard has too many keys <i>  and it is affecting the KVM.
1	It is a very nice keyboard but some of the  <i> keys dont work right <i> .
1	They  <i> keys are hard to press <i>  so my typing has slowed down quite a bit.
1	so even though my hands are in a more natural position (wrist straight) my wrists hurt after typing because it's so  <i> hard to press the keys <i> .
1	Although the ergonomic style of this keyboard is nice and alleviates wrist pain by keeping hands aligned with forearms, the <i>  keys stick terribly <i>  on this keyboard and there are often several extra characters entered that I must go back and delete, slowing down productivity.
1	The  <i> keys felt a bit mushy <i>  and I often would get multiple capitals when using the shift key.
1	I, too, find Microsoft's re-arrangment of the Ins/Del set of keys as well as the arrow  <i> keys unfathomable <i> .
1	Mouse pad is in a bad location making it  <i> difficult to operate keys <i>  on the right side of the keyboard.
1	The  <i> characters rub off the keys  <i> after about three months of constant use.
1	The  <i> keys require too much force to depress <i> , and are too thick, which makes it difficult to type fast without creating typos.
1	Otherwise, it's was a functional, ergonomic keyboard, that is, until the "1", "4", and "7" number  <i> keys stopped working <i> .
1	good quality overall , but an extremely sensitive touch pad along with  <i> sticky keys <i>  that will occasionally give a long line of the same letter, or scroll uncontrollably to the top or bottom of the page prevent me from giving it a top rating.
1	The  <i> keys are very small <i> .
1	I could find no physical or environmental reason for the  <i> keys to stop working <i> .
1	The key action is too stiff, the programmable  <i> keys are not really programmable <i> , and the space key sticks on occasion.
1	The  <i> keys are now much louder <i>  and the letters have come off of half of the keys after only two weeks!
1	Some  <i> keys were hard to push <i> .
1	It's really bulky one, and  <i> keys are not soft at all <i> .
1	I had  <i> trouble even in pressing some keys <i>  - had to return it on the same day I received the product.
1	I have had 2 of these microsoft keyboards, and they all have had the same problem, the  <i> keys stop working <i> .
1	Half the time I miss it or I  <i> hit multiple keys <i> .
1	It was light and typed fairly nicely, but after a few weeks <i>  keys started getting stuck <i>  or just not working at all.
1	Also, a few  <i> keys have just totally gone dead  <i> and you have to bang them down to make it work again.
1	I have never had this problem with other keyboards, even my Gyration very mini-keyboard where the  <i> keys are very small <i>  and very close.
1	In only about 6 months the paint on the  <i> keys are worn off badly <i> .
1	The  <i> keys are mushy  <i> and feel cheap.
1	-- While i don't mind this keyboard, the hard  <i> keys are frustrating <i> .
1	First, I personally feel that inlaid  <i> keys are a gamers worst nightmare <i> .
1	PROs + Size is excellent, smaller than a typical tv remote + Keyboard is very compact but the keys are large enough to be usable + Touchpad is a key advantage of the design and is big enough to be usable + Mouse keys and arrow bottons are well placed, below the touchpad + Range is fine (some reviewers criticized range but I had no problems, see note below on line of sight) + Battery life is good CONs -  <i> Keys are poor quality  <i> and often stick or require multiple touches to register (sometimes you press a key once and have it fill the screen with the same character, other times you have to press the same key 4 or 5 times to get anything) - Touchpad often is not responsive (when it works it's great but often it doesn't and you have to turn it off and on again) - Appears to require line of sight connection with USB receiver.
1	- Frequently have to turn on/off the keyboard to unfreeze the keys and touchpad (even in the middle of active use) - Missing F9-F12 function  <i> keys which is a problem <i>  for some applications (not a huge problem but an issue) - Have to recharge from a PC with a USB port.
1	I didn't like the  <i> way the keys or the space bar responded <i> , all very stiff & noisy.
1	This keyboard seems to  <i> drop keystrokes  <i> (particularly the spacebar) and there is no known workaround.
1	And the way the  <i> keys pushed felt weird <i> , like I couldn't really feel if I had struck the key, I had to look at my screen to see what I'd typed.
1	The tactile response of the  <i> keys is less crisp <i> , the texture of the keys is more grainy, and the keys do not appear to be as well attached.
1	I was surprised to read that so many others are having this same issue, with  <i> keys that up and stop working <i> .
1	I've had the second one for roughly nine months and now, like other users, certain  <i> keys are unresponsive <i>  such as the 'n.
1	The  <i> keys have a cheap plastic feel  <i> unlike the earlier MS ergonomic keyboards.
1	the lay out is just fine, but it took a few weeks to learn to hit the  <i> keys hard  <i> enough to make them work, I now find myself pounding away at my keyboard, which is working ok for me.
1	the  <i> keys are also so hard  <i> to use, I do end up making countless mistakes even after using it for over 6 months now.
1	This evening in an attempt to fix it I plug it in only to discover that more  <i> keys don't work <i> .
1	These  <i> keys have funny shapes  <i> to fit with the overall shape of the keyboard.
