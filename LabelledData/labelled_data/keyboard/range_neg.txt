1	Was really excited about having a compact keyboard with backlit keys for my home media center, but the  <i> range proved to be a problem <i> .
1	the touch pad wasn't as responsive and the  <i> range wasn't as good <i>  either.
1	I read through several reviews that mentioned the  <i> range was not as advertised <i> .
1	The  <i> range is terrible <i> .
1	The wireless  <i> range was less than 3 feet <i> .
1	Also for some odd reason if I used the laser pointer (which I honestly cared nothing about) it would break the bluetooth pairing and you would need to use another mouse to re-connect the device I may have recived a faulty unit but I've noticed others complaining of  <i> short range <i>  as well so I've decided to return the unit for a refund and explore other options.
1	The  <i> range on this is pretty poor <i>  when holding it in a comfortable position, around 4 feet.
1	CONS: ----- 1)  <i> Short range <i> , also reported by others here.
1	The wireless  <i> range of the device seems limited <i> , even though it says it has a range of 50 feet.
1	 <i> can't get consistent wireless range <i>  from the couch, especially if a piece of furniture is in the way.
1	I must have gotten a bad one because the  <i> range was only about 2 <i> .
1	The  <i> range on the product I received was atrocious <i> .
1	The  <i> range is less than 15ft <i> .
1	Be very cautious of this device's  <i> limited range <i> , very shaky performance while in range, poor mouse button placement, and lack of long-term durability.
1	With that, the  <i> range is not 10m <i>  (approx.
1	The  <i> range was fairly limited <i> , about 10 feet usually.
1	The  <i> range is strange <i> , it hesitates a lot from 6 feet away.
1	The  <i> range is not that great <i> .
1	This keyboard works good, but the  <i> usable range is only about eight to ten feet <i>  before it loses connection.
1	a) keys get stuck b) <i>  range is at most 2 feet <i> , not *up to 100* feet as advertized on the box.
1	 <i> Limited range  <i> and stuck keys makes it useless for HTPC.
1	1 star was taken off for the poor signal quality of this item  <i> even at close ranges <i> , and 1 star is taken off for the lack of distance this allows you to have between the PC and the keyboard (in the product description it states this works within 30M which I assume they mean 30 meters.
1	This would be a great HTPC keyboard, except that the  <i> range is terrible <i> .
1	This wasn't a problem, but I would have been really annoyed if it had  <i> failed at that range <i> .
1	The wireless  <i> range is terrible <i>  and it will not work if there is anything between you and the receiver, including your hand holding on the keyboard.
1	Why couldnt they get a decent  <i> usable range  <i> out of this?
1	Lastly, I cannot comment on long term durability as I returned the device after a few weeks of use (or should I say non-use) due to the <i>  range issue <i> .
1	The  <i> range is not that great <i> ; about 10~15ft and you definitely notice the loss in response (the Lenovo N5901 got 5x+ the range than this device).
1	Working  <i> range ended up being about 4'-6' max <i> .
1	Then about two months later, I noticed the  <i> range wasn't that good <i>  anymore.
1	Cons: I've had  <i> major issues with range <i> .
1	Some people said the wireless connection is bad and  <i> short range  <i> but some said it was good.
1	With no walls between the keyboard and the pc/RF dongle the <i>  range of reliable operation  <i> is less than 12 feet.
1	The wireless is OK, the wireless  <i> range is not very good <i> .
1	Pros: * Backlit keys * Mouse pad that works in both orientations * rechargable * very small and portable * useless laser pointer (maybe a con also as the kids might shoot each other in the face with it) * fairly cheap Cons: -  <i> limited range <i> , like 10 feet at best - mine wont connect using the extension cable, must plug directly into machine.
1	Just be aware of its  <i> short range <i> .
1	Seems to work okay,but it has a very  <i> short range <i> .
1	In addition, the  <i> range is horrible <i> --maybe 3 feet, which is to say it does not reach my couch.
1	this is a good little device BUT the track pad did not perform well and the  <i> range was less than 20ft <i>  if you were wanting it to go through a wall.
1	I suppose the designers could have sacrificed some battery life at the  <i> expense of a decent wireless range <i> .
1	The  <i> range is limited <i>  to about 4 feet, yes, with new batteries.
1	The  <i> range is horrible <i> .
1	This remote's  <i> range is terrible <i> .
1	The  <i> range on this item was so bad  <i> that I could not use it.
1	The following day I used it for the first time and realized the  <i> range was a bit short <i> , but it's okay as my living room isn't too big and no real problem with the range offered by the device.
1	The lights work well on this remote, but the  <i> range is an issue <i> .
1	Bottom-line Great Backlight features Great options, for price  <i> Poor range difficult  <i> connect with the USB dongle receiver Keyboard mislabeling issue.
1	The  <i> range on this thing is terrible <i> .
1	the  <i> range on this is a complete joke <i>  5ft max touch pad barely works i bought a Rii mini and its amazing works great dont buy this buy a Rii mini bluetooth!
1	The  <i> range is not all that great  <i> and certainly not 30M as advertised.
1	The biggest issue I have is that the <i>  range is just terrible <i> , I have the dongle plugged into the computer and if anything is in the way or I have more than 4 feet away, if that, the keyboard becomes very unresponsive or stops working altogether.
1	I gave this a 3 star because of the  <i> range being horrible <i>  and it really should be better.
1	I connected the bluetooth dongle to a USB extension cable to raise it higher ( <i> try to improve range <i> ), which now just makes the cut for me to use this device with my Home Theater PC from my couch (some 13 feet away).
1	on paper the promising features are: - extremly low form factor - 30 meters range - backlit - rechargable All sounds great but here's my findings after 1 week of trying to make it work: - quite  <i> ridicilous effective range <i>  - won't work correctly from within 10ft - 50% of keys type are not being transmitted, you end up typing everything twice - stuck keys - electronically not physically Overall nice try, but no cigar.
1	The  <i> range is absolutely terrible <i> .
1	The  <i> range isn't that great <i>  and the mousepad isn't really sensitive enough for fine adjustments.
1	Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that the  <i> range was so limited <i>  that the USB dongle had to be on the front of the PC and even then the range was only 3-5 feet.
1	The  <i> range, however, is absolutely ridiculous <i> .
1	Fyi, I ordered the Bluetooth version expecting usual BT range of 10m/33', but the  <i> range on that one was dismal <i>  as well (less than 6', regardless of whether or not a dog was in the way).
1	I tried plugging it into a front USB and moved closer, to see if it was a  <i> range problem <i> .
1	* RANGE:  I haven't checked it's  <i> range limit <i> , but it seems good, which would also seem to make it a good choice for use with game consoles like a Sony PS3.
1	Item worked decently, albeit with a  <i> shorter than advertised range <i> .
