1	The biggest issue is that there is a bit of  <i> play in the spacebar <i> , so you have to get accustomed to pushing through that first bit, then really whacking it to get the space you wanted.
1	My biggest frustration, just edging out the  <i> spacebar issue <i> , is the fact that the keyboard simply makes a racket.
1	Pros: - perfect ergonomics - nice leather wrist padding Cons: - noisy spacebar -  <i> spacebar presses harder <i>  then letter keys - F-keys devided into two groups, while classically it should be three - a bit large Could be perfect without  <i> issue with spacebar <i> .
1	I even have the  <i> sticky spacebar <i>  problem, and given how poorly constructed the keyboard is, I took the time to pry up the spacebar and determine if the metal crossbar wasn't properly fitted.
1	Any pressure at the outer corners of the  <i> spacebar causes the cheap plastic to warp <i>  and bind the plunger mechanism.
1	I find it amazing that MS did not figure out that this  <i> spacebar is a complete piece of junk <i>  before it mass produced this device.
1	I tried to use this for a day and it was too painful--the  <i> spacebar is impossible to press <i> .
1	The  <i> spacebar is awful <i> .
1	Next is the "Y" key, which seems to be just  <i> as bad as the spacebar <i> , with exactly the same issue.
1	It addition to being extremely noisy when pressed, the  <i> spacebar requires more pressure <i>  than an average keyboard to use.
1	Its size is a bit larger than I'm accustomed to, the keys do not accept double letters and make me hit the same key three to four times to get two f's or two l'l or two anything, and the  <i> spacebar has to be hammered <i>  to work, but all in all, things were working out.
1	so stiff, this is me typing with it: dont buy thisproduct beccause ther  <i> spacebar is complete crap <i>  this productis conpleteltterri8bleahd the spacebar iiscausing an excruciatingpaininnmy thumb.
1	The  <i> spacebar is really noisy <i> .
1	but if so then you have other problems to focus) and i laughed at the reviewers saying about the  <i> loud spacebar <i> .
1	After only a few days of use, the  <i> spacebar stopped working <i> , and the number keys were either broken or typing strange combinations.
1	As other reviewers have said, the  <i> spacebar is defective <i> .
1	The  <i> spacebar has more resistance <i>  than the other keys and that is not pleasant.
1	BUT the  <i> spacebar is terrible <i> --much too hard to press, especially from the left and right ends of it, where a touch typist normally would hit it.
1	Maybe a two-finger "hunt and peck" typist wouldn't notice this, but for this touch typist the problematic/defective  <i> spacebar is a dealbreaker <i> .
1	I would recommend avoiding this keyboard for one specific reason: the  <i> "sticky" spacebar <i> .
1	The most recent one has a very  <i> stiff spacebar  <i> - something that my other ones have not had.
1	The other reviewers are right - if the <i> spacebar comes stiff <i> , it really sucks!
1	However, the  <i> spacebar is massive  <i> (and not split in two as it should have been), with the actuator right in the middle.
1	The sticking  <i> spacebar makes this keyboard useless <i> .
1	The <i> spacebar renders this keyboard unusable <i> .
1	The  <i> spacebar in particular becomes very loud <i>  as a result of this.
1	I haven't had  <i> problems with the spacebar  <i> like many others have, though.
1	The  <i> spacebar is half-responsive <i> , and the tiny little function, arrow and page keys are a nightmare.
1	I couldn't hear you over this  <i> noisy spacebar <i> .
1	 <i> spacebar is hard <i>  to press when you actually type.
1	As has been stated, the  <i> spacebar is harder to push  <i> than other keys and significantly louder.
1	This keyboard has a lot of great features (scroll control, etc) but the  <i> spacebar makes this keyboard unusable <i> .
1	They keys are incredibly hard to press, and the  <i> spacebar is noisy <i>  and stiff.
1	I type all day and there's  <i> no way I can use the spacebar  <i> without forcibly pressing it down at times so it will make a space, not all the time,but enough times that force me to separate words running together and very very annoying.
1	It's that damn  <i> spacebar that's a huge hinderance <i> .
1	This keyboard is enormous, but there is only one giant, loud,  <i> sticky spacebar <i> .
1	The  <i> spacebar is so bad <i> , the product is completely unusable for me.
1	I don't understand the good reviews it got here on Amazon, because reviewers on other sites also claimed to have  <i> issues with the spacebar <i> .
1	It has the  <i> loudest spacebar  <i> you have ever heard in your life.
1	the  <i> spacebar key is so loud <i>  it would surely drive everyone in my office nuts, not to mention myself.
1	I cannot possibly imagine how the other reviewers use this keyboard - try it and find out just how  <i> loud a spacebar  <i> can be.
1	It is really too bad, Microsoft designed the perfect keyboard, then made it useless the  <i> spacebar is so obnoxiously loud <i> .
1	Loud keys are a serious issue, but I sent this back and exchanged it because of  <i> issues with the spacebar <i> .
1	I liked having the shortcut keys that reduced the amount of mousing I had to do, but the  <i> spacebar was hard to press <i>  and the keys felt a little gummy.
1	The  <i> spacebar that was loose <i> , I popped it back in but it feels like it will wear out fast.
1	However, the  <i> spacebar is difficult to press <i>  30% of the time.
1	However, the keys were sticky and noisy, and the  <i> spacebar stuck <i>  about every fifth time it was struck.
1	The  <i> stuck spacebar <i>  alone made the keyboard a failure.
1	After returning and replacing the keyboard for the second time, (because of the spacebar) I realized the  <i> spacebar has a design flaw <i> .
1	The <i>  major issue with the keyboard is the spacebar <i> , which due to poor design, doesn't always register keypresses when pressed at the edge.
1	The keys are stiff, and the  <i> spacebar is agonizingly stiff <i> .
1	Since the keys(especially  <i> spacebar) are pretty tight <i>  even compared to regular non-ergo keyboards, it increased the intensity and frequency of the pain I experienced earlier.
1	And above all, the crappy  <i> spacebar was clunky <i> , loud and felt incredibly cheap -- which is ot what I wanted in a quiet keyboard.
1	The <i>  spacebar is very stiff <i>  and oddly designed.
1	I should also say that my fiance, who has large hands, felt the  <i> spacebar was a problem <i>  for him as well.
1	But the  <i> spacebar was the real "sticking" point <i>  that got me to decide to pack it back up today in order to return it.
1	The  <i> spacebar is particularly loud  <i> and clunky.
1	The  <i> spacebar on the Ergo is loose <i> and clicks loudly each time I depress it.
1	While the keyboard was super quiet, ergonomic and convenient, after only 2 1/2 weeks, the  <i> spacebar started sticking <i>  when pressed.
1	) The third keyboard I bought had the same  <i> TERRIBLE spacebar <i> .
1	love everything but the  <i> spacebar is kind of hard to press <i>  and takes decided effort.
1	The one I got more recently at home has one of the  <i> problematic spacebars <i> .
1	The  <i> spacebar was very noisy <i>  - and drove me crazy.
1	It would be great keyboard if the  <i> spacebar problem fixed <i> .
1	The  <i> spacebar requires an unusual amount of force <i> , compared to the rest of the keypads.
1	It's frustrating to  <i> hit the spacebar <i>  and get nothing; and then have to hit it again, harder.
1	The  <i> spacebar is practically unusable <i> .
1	Unfortunately, like other 1-star reviews, he couldn't  <i> stand the hard spacebar <i> .
1	The main keys are fairly quiet, but the  <i> spacebar "clacks" like a gun <i>  going off in comparison.
1	I purchased this keyboard a little over 3 months ago and already the letters are coming off the keys and the  <i> spacebar sticks <i> .
1	The new one made an awful thumping/ <i> click with the spacebar <i> .
1	As often mentioned, the  <i> spacebar on this keyboard is stiff <i>  and loud.
1	EDIT: 7/2012 The shift and  <i> spacebar keys have developed too much resistance <i> , and it's worsening my already sore tendons.
1	The  <i> spacebar is difficult to press <i> , and once you do press it it tends to autorepeat uncontrollably.
1	* The fourth and assuredly final one, bought as a replacement for the first, had the  <i> spacebar key fall off <i>  as soon as I took it out of the box.
1	The  <i> spacebar is not easy to push  <i> down w/ your thumbs.
1	The  <i> spacebar is really too stiff <i> !
1	Pay close attention here: the  <i> spacebar is unbelievably stiff <i> , just as another reviewer mentioned.
1	The  <i> spacebar is stiff  <i> in the center and jams when hit at the sides.
1	I would need to make a constant conscious effort to keep my thumbs extended, and even then the  <i> spacebar would be stiffer <i>  than expected.
1	The  <i> spacebar is huge <i>  and clunky - it makes typing loud, slow and difficult and completely offsets any ergonomic benefits.
1	I've found the  <i> spacebar key VERY hard  <i> to press with the right hand.
1	However, as some others have mentioned, the  <i> spacebar requires a lot of force <i>  if you have small hands and cannot press it down in the center.
1	The  <i> spacebar takes noise <i>  and clunkyness to a whole new level.
