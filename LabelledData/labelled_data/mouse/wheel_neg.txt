1	The performance MX  <i> wheel have a cheap feeling <i>  to the mouse wheel spin, with hard clicks.
1	But the  <i> worst part by far is the scroll wheel <i> .
1	Responsivity is fine for my simple needs on my personal laptop; I doubt this mouse would meet gamers' needs and the scroll  <i> wheel would not be comfortable <i>  for a full day of computer work.
1	Also after only a few days of light use, the scroll  <i> wheel is now very loose <i>  (in click mode).
1	But the scroll  <i> wheel SUCKED <i>  the big brown eye, and I have never gotten used to controling the mouse (It's the only true vertical mouse so you have to move the mouse from your elbow and forearm, not just flick your wrist like all the other ergonomically slanted or flat mice).
1	Cons: The tiny little scroll  <i> wheel is difficult to click <i>  and not particularly comfortable.
1	I have had this mouse less then a year and the scroll  <i> wheel has gone bad <i> .
1	The scroll  <i> wheel intermittently goes out <i>  and there is no longer that distinguishable "bite" when turning.
1	This one has one as well but its only to change the scroll mouse, and the search button or third button is moved pressing the scroll  <i> wheel which is terrible <i>  because you have to press so hard that your pointer moves away from the word selected and then it doesn't search.
1	I was still able to scroll after I pulled the rubber out, but it was more  <i> difficult now to turn the wheel <i> .
1	The rubber grip on the main scroll  <i> wheel actually comes loose <i>  from the metal component, making the free shipping not so 'free spinning'.
1	But this scrolling  <i> wheel renders the mouse's middle-click almost useless <i> .
1	The application switching  <i> wheel is located too far way <i>  from the "front" and "back" buttons, and moving your thumb from the buttons to the wheel forces the mouse to move because of where the back of the mouse sits relative to the base of your thumb.
1	My main concern is that after about a month of owning the mouse the scroll  <i> wheel lost its sensitivity <i> , now I find scrolling pages in documents to be a real chore, the click wheel has become unreliable and I have resorted to clicking the scroll bar and dragging, this is a major issue for me, I may resort to my old battery powered microsoft mouse, I havn't looked into a replacement yet, but may soon.
1	The top  <i> wheel is very cheap <i> .
1	This is a shame because the mouse is otherwise good (apart from the fact that depressing the scroll wheel for middle mouse  <i> click tilts the wheel <i>  to the side).
1	The issue of not being able to use the  <i> wheel to click is a little annoying <i> .
1	The first thing that I noticed is that the scroll  <i> wheel has a very choppy feeling <i> .
1	The scroll  <i> wheel is insanely sensitive <i> , I've spent about an hour with the settings unable to change the fact that even the slightest touch to the wheel will make it scroll.
1	The middle mouse button  <i> (wheel) is already failing <i>  to register clicks after only two days of use.
1	Overall the mouse feels cheap with lackluster plastic chrome trim and a  <i> faulty mouse wheel <i> .
1	After a few months the middle  <i> "wheel" stopped working <i> .
1	Oddly, many of its best features, like speedshift and the document flip  <i> wheel are impossible to find <i>  on other mice.
1	You have to press the scroll  <i> wheel relatively hard <i>  to the left and right to get the horizontal scrolling to work, I have experienced better.
1	The gear shift scroll  <i> wheel is half gimmicky/half useful <i> .
1	The scroll  <i> wheel has too little resistance <i>  in either free or "clicky" mode 10.
1	There is a dedicated button to switch between free and  <i> "clicky" scroll wheel <i> .
1	Aside from that, the mouse  <i> wheel is just too sensitive <i>  to be useful.
1	Now I can remove the software and maybe it'll be smooth like how I wanted it, but that defeats the purpose of getting a new mouse, because w/o the software the horizontal scroll  <i> wheel becomes very slow <i>  and I lose the function of the other buttons.
1	This made the scroll  <i> wheel very awkward <i>  to use.
1	The scroll  <i> wheel is set too high <i> , it should be almost flush with the surface, and the scrolling is not smooth at all.
1	If your look at lots of pictures the no click  <i> wheel can make it difficult to stop <i>  on the correct picture or even back up to it, and I'm being polite.
1	The no click  <i> wheel offers no extra resolution <i>  or help.
1	However I have a major beef with the scroll  <i> wheel, which is fairly stiff <i> , i.
1	the smallest rotation possible on the  <i> wheel only scrolls down a tiny bit <i> , which means that it takes more turns of the wheel to scroll down.
1	This mouse is ok on the button/click feel side of things but the  <i> wheel is ultra sensitive <i>  and has no clicking detentes in it.
1	This is an otherwise great mouse - right size, good touch and feel, small USB plug, light weight, however, the flimsy scroll  <i> wheel is the weakest point <i> .
1	The biggest drawback to the Performance MX model is that the wheel sits too low to the top of the mosue so that almost invariably, when you try to work the wheel for either side, you unintentionally depress the  <i> wheel wtih unintended consequences <i> .
1	The second  <i> wheel doesn't scroll <i> , it rocks, and can only be set as document flip or zoom.
1	However, even in the traditional mode the  <i> wheel doesn't offer enough resistance <i> , so it was far too easy for me to trigger scrolling.
1	It does seem to have problems tracking on some surfaces, but the one thing that creates the biggest annoyance is when I run it in parallels on auto-CAD the scroll  <i> wheel is way too sensitive <i>  and I can't seem to change the settings once in windows (running parallels on macbook) The good thing is that all of the buttons help to navigate quickly.
1	The  <i> wheel rattled so much <i>  I wasn't sure whether or not it was broken.
1	The mouse  <i> wheel is very very sensitive <i> .
1	With the new Performance Mouse MX, Setpoint doesn't have the wheel tab - so the auto-shift from clicky to  <i> free-wheel is not settable <i> .
1	The worst part is that the scroll  <i> wheel is very very loose <i> .
1	Everything was smooth sailing until a last week, when the scroll  <i> wheel broke <i> .
1	This mouse was good for the first few months then the rubber on the scroll  <i> wheel started disintegrating <i> .
1	There is a small button behind the scroll  <i> wheel which is uncomfortable <i>  when using the scroll wheel.
1	It was  <i> difficult to click the scroll wheel <i>  and no definitive sound or feeling that it had "taken".
1	Not so good:   <i> wheel action is clunky <i>  compared to my Logitech mouse wheel; packaging is the absolute worst to get into.
1	Cons: The  <i> scrollwheel feels flimsy <i>  and makes metal "clinging" sounds occasionally and as previously mentioned, it scrolls seamlessly, which makes tasks like middle clicking difficult.
1	Additionally, the scroll  <i> wheel is so sensitive <i>  that even in click-mode, it sometimes registers the next click before the wheel is physically clicked into position.
1	But I am annoyed at Microsoft's complacence and bad design - their "ergonomic" mouse's scroll  <i> wheel was so hard to press <i> , it was hard to use as a middle button and caused more strain than a normal mouse.
1	first off the scroll  <i> wheel is quite awful <i> .
1	I repeat, 60% OF THE TIME, due to the  <i> poorly designed wheel <i> .
1	the only issue i had was with the scroll  <i> wheel which unfortunately does not click <i>  as you scroll.
1	this is because the  <i> wheel itself does not scroll <i> , instead there is like a rubber piece that rotates around an unmoving round middle button.
1	this has started to get annoying  as now the  <i> wheel won't turn properly <i>  and is a pain to use.
1	in summary the mouse was good, until the  <i> wheel started to break apart <i>  due to lackluster construction/design.
1	As many others have mentioned, I confirm  <i> issues with the wheel <i> .
1	Yes, the smooth scrolling  <i> wheel will feel a bit weird <i>  in the beginning but as others mentioned I got used to it and actually I sort of prefer it now.
1	My main  <i> problem is with the the wheel <i>  click functionality, it's a crap of a design.
1	But the  <i> cheap construction of the wheel <i>  (you could almost hear rattling metal and sideway movement) and it's bad click behavior is a minus.
1	That's not a huge deal, but the deal breaker comes when you attempt to use the side-scrolling feature (which I use a lot on documents and emails) and you quickly realize the  <i> wheel will shake <i>  up and down and your pointer on screen starts going crazy.
1	This is because the side-to-side action on the so-called high end scroll  <i> wheel on this mouse is so stiff <i>  that you are forced to first scroll up a bit before you can go side to side.
1	The ergonomic design leaves allot to be desired, indeed it is a laptop mouse and as such you can expect for some concessions when it goes to ergonomics, but it having an analog mouse  <i> wheel is simply annoying <i> , and don't get me started on those puny extra buttons on the sides of the mouse that will not let you click them without lifting your hand of the mouse.
1	The new fancy  <i> scrollwheel cannot be used <i>  as a regular button - wheel click is hardwired to change the scroll mode.
1	This could have been negated had Logitech elected to use a cable like that found on their G700 mouse wherein the micro USB connector is encased in a larger than normal chunk of plastic that is keyed to fit into a guide on the front of the mouse Pros/cons relative to the MX Revolution: + Subjectively, I prefer the matte silver accents on the Performance MX to the piano black of the MX Revolution + No charging contacts to wear out + Doesn't require dedicated/specific charging base + Receiver is much smaller, approximately 20% as long (~7mm vs ~38mm) as that for the MX Revolution - The MX Revolution could be configured to switch from regular to freewheel scrolling based on the speed the user is scrolling at, the Performance MX can only be switched via a physical button located below/behind the scroll  <i> wheel - this is also less functional <i>  in that the button used to switch scroll modes on the Performance MX cannot be used/remapped for any other purpose as can the button that occupies the same place on the MX Revolution.
1	My second  <i> gripe is with the wheel <i>  at the top.
1	The scroll  <i> wheel does not click <i>  and has a rubber coating for traction.
1	The mouse worked fine for a few days and the scroll  <i> wheel malfunctioned <i> .
1	Minor issues include the  <i> wheel's uncomfortable clicking <i>  action, and poor left right ability.
1	The thumb  <i> "wheel" is ergonomically uncomfortable <i> .
1	The thumb  <i> "wheel" is too hard to push / rotate <i> .
1	The thumb  <i> "wheel" just has a mushy feel <i>  to it.
1	The right click is extremely sensitive making the hard tilt of the scroll  <i> wheel even more of a problem <i> .
1	4) the "quick flip"  <i> wheel is terribly located <i>  under your thumb.
1	-Secondly the scroll  <i> wheel is too low <i> ; so if you wish to tilt the wheel to the right, i.
1	This means the left side of the scroll  <i> wheel is barely above the surface <i> , whilst the right side is about the right height.
1	Worked really well while with good battery life (maybe 2 or 3 batteries in that time) till the scroll  <i> wheel stopped working <i> .
1	The MS mouse was total crap - the  <i> wheel was too hard to press <i> , causing more wrist strain, and the mouse drivers haven't been updated to the 21st century - you can't reassign the left-right wheel motion to actions or keystrokes.
1	+ all the buttons and wheel are easy to access (large hands) What I don't like - the free  <i> wheel option becomes sticky <i>  (I mean it does not roll so freely) after a few months.
1	That fancy scroll  <i> wheel keeps going out <i> .
1	I like losing the wire, and it works OK, but the scroll  <i> wheel is way too sensative <i> , even with the mouse settings in Control Panel set way low.
1	One big issue is that my scroll  <i> wheel often gets stuck <i>  in the free spinning mode and then will randomly switch back into normal scrolling after a few minutes.
1	The thumb  <i> wheel is marginally useful <i>  and feels like it's in the way at times.
1	The center  <i> wheel also isn't as accurate <i>  as I'm used to.
1	Yes, I tried every setting imaginable to try and tweak them and gave them a fair chance, but no matter what, the  <i> wheel scrolling is not as FLUID <i>  as in the old mice.
1	The scroll  <i> wheel is a joke <i>  -- I much prefer having a metallic wheel with some heft to it.
1	Zero reception problems (but keep your cell phone away from it =) ) Cons: If you have large hands, the side  <i> wheel can get in the way <i>  of your thumb.
1	The biggest con: the scroll  <i> wheel is *extremely* sensitive <i> , even in 'click-to-click' mode (which is meant for more precise scrolling, more like on a standard mouse; you get that tactile 'click' when you scroll the wheel).
1	A couple of observations: I don't like the  <i> wheel -- it is not smooth-scrolling <i>  like my other desktop MS wireless mouse.
1	The  <i> wheel feels cheap <i>  and plastic with no inertia.
1	Also the smooth scroll  <i> wheel doesn't work <i>  so well when zooming in on photos.
1	I do a lot of work with spreadsheets and the sideways motion of the top  <i> wheel does not work <i>  as well as my previous 2 wheel mouse.
1	Also,  <i> wheel scrolling with the V450 feels crippling <i> -- which can't be good, since that's my clue that prolonged usage may result in lovely things like CTS and what-not.
1	The only problem i have is the  <i> wheel track is ridiculously fast <i> , which forces me to open up the mouse menu every time i first connect the mouse to the laptop and recalibrate it.
1	The  <i> wheel seems very sensitive <i>  and I use the mouse a lot for middle clicking inside a web browser to open links in a new tab.
1	The super sensitivity of the  <i> wheel presents a problem <i> , because as I push down a lot of time that moves the wheel a bit and then the page scrolls and I can't click my link.
1	as well, i'd say the whole design of the scroll  <i> wheel buttons is worse <i>  than previous logitech mice i've had (i've had all the recent top end mice).
1	Was having a very  <i> hard time trying to configure the scroll wheel <i>  to work correctly.
1	Also the  <i> wheel seems real jerky <i>  when you rotate it.
1	My only gripe is that the  <i> thumbwheel is virtually useless <i>  with a Mac.
1	I love everything about this mouse except for two things: 1)The scroll  <i> wheel does not protrude high enough <i> , from the inclined top surface, to leave enough grip for a right horizontal scrolling.
1	Loved this mouse until the  <i> wheel became sluggish <i>  and finally stopped working.
1	Even then I would hesitate to buy it because the thing that sets it apart is the scroll  <i> wheel, and it is too delicate <i> .
1	So far, go good with the mouse, the  <i> wheel seems a tad floppy <i>  (it wiggles).
1	The left click works great again, but to my dismay, the mouse  <i> wheel no longer functions <i> .
1	The only issue I find with this mouse is that the  <i> scrollwheel on it clicks in way too easily <i> .
1	The scrolling  <i> wheel feels lose <i> , and thus cheap, but works fine once you get used to it.
1	The mouse  <i> wheel is lousy <i> .
1	But now the MX Revo thing with the middle mouse  <i> wheel doesnt work right <i> .
1	The middle scroll  <i> wheel has no tactile feedback <i>  and after 6 months the middle click function, which I have mapped to open links in a new tab, completely crapped out.
1	The  <i> wheel scroll is a bit iffy <i>  because it isn't detent scrolling so it takes awhile to get use to.
1	The right side button is awkward to press but doable however the  <i> wheel scroll button is just annoying <i> .
1	Buttons /  <i> wheel are not as configurable <i>  as I would like.
1	This would get 5 stars if it wasn't for a  <i> very bad quality scroll wheel <i> .
1	CONS: The Battery life is a little bit shorter than other mice, but the  <i> major con is the scroll wheel <i> .
1	Overall: This mouse is okay, but the the blue laser is NOT worth it for the  <i> terrible scroll wheel <i> .
1	The scrolling  <i> wheel was defective <i>  as it wobbled back and forth creating a terrible, inconsistent, squeaking click.
1	*** Both the 6000 and Explorer Mine Mouse use a non-incremental, non-bumpy, continuous rolling of the scroll  <i> wheel that is a bit too fluidly smooth <i>  for my taste.
1	A bigger problem - for me anyways - is that now using the  <i> scrollwheel as a button is very dicey <i> .
1	Also, it's  <i> very difficult to click on the mouse wheel <i>  to use it as a middle mouse button.
1	The rubber on the  <i> wheel eventually got really loose <i>  and started falling apart, now the wheel is completely unusable.
1	The MX revolution looks great on paper, and has good build quality, but the thumb  <i> wheel ruins the whole computing experience <i> .
1	This thumb  <i> wheel is a real nuisance <i> .
1	I bought this to replace my Logitech MX Reveloution mouse in which the scroll wheel fly  <i> wheel effect stopped working <i>  due to heavy wear.
1	Recently, my new mouse's scroll  <i> wheel buttons stopped working <i> .
1	) the scroll  <i> wheel is very loose <i> .
1	My only other complaint is the scroll  <i> wheel settings are hard to adjust <i> .
1	This mouse is by far and away the best mouse I have ever had in terms of comfort and ease of use but having a  <i> scroll wheel break <i>  after not even a year is just ridiculous for a $75 mouse.
1	It's very comfortable and smooth, and the free-spinning  <i> wheel is really useful <i> .
1	The only negative about the mouse is the stiff  <i> spring on the wheel <i>  button.
1	The unusually high tension on the  <i> wheel button can be a bit annoying <i> , and I wonder if it might be bad for carpal tunnel-type problems.
1	The  <i> wheel button became useless <i>  doing the same things as described here.
1	The keyboard is outstanding and as soon as I got my big hand on the mouse it was love at first sight that is until I discovered that the  <i> wheel wouldn't work <i>  as a middle button.
1	The  <i> wheel is too sensitive <i>  and won't stay still allowing it to stabilize where you want it to click.
1	The  <i> wheel works intermittently <i>  but less times than more.
1	The  <i> wheel does not click <i>  when pressed to the right or left, and it requires a good deal of force to move.
1	But it has a fatal  <i> flaw in the scroll wheel <i> .
1	I took the hint that a new mouse was in order when the paint wore off the left mouse button and the  <i> wheel stopped scrolling <i>  to the left.
1	only 3-5 days with 10hr/day usage ) Cons: 1 - The thumb  <i> wheel is way sensitive <i>  that it should be, making it almost useless!
1	The other  <i> wheel is mostly useless <i> .
1	The mouse is really confortable it works well, but the mouse  <i> wheel is really anoying <i>  it scrolls to fast and it goes to the end of a page in just one second, the position of the forward and back page could be a better positioned.
1	The scroll  <i> wheel button is also very stiff <i> .
1	I thought my Logitech G9x scroll  <i> wheel button was stiff <i> , but the Mobile Mouse 6000 is maybe twice as stiff.
1	The stiffer scroll  <i> wheel button makes it difficult  <i> to use tabbed browsing, and combined with a jittery scroll wheel on the 6000, it's hard to browse using FireFox or IE8.
1	another thing is that the  <i> wheel click is very inaccurate <i> , since most of the time you press it it does not work,  and it never feels like clicking, so you don't really know whether you clicked or not (most times, wheel click does not work).
1	the tilt of the  <i> wheel also does not work <i>  often, and it is pretty much unusable.
1	The scroll  <i> wheel is so stiff <i>  and jerky, I don't even use it.
1	The scroll  <i> wheel has no tactile steps <i> , so it just scrolls completely smoothly.
1	I haven't used this in a long time, but having it at a desktop now I notice the  <i> wheel button is accidentally pressed  <i> all the time, there is not much of a "click" either.
1	Unfortunately, the scroll  <i> wheel sucks so bad <i> , it makes this otherwise-five-star mouse a one-star piece of junk.
1	The second time that the scroll  <i> wheel stopped working <i> , even compressed air didn't fix it.
1	Also, when watching movies on OSX quicktime, if hyper scrolling is enabled, the  <i> wheel is VERY sensitive <i>  and can pause the video.
1	I didn't notice this mentioned in other reviews until after I bought it, but the middle  <i> wheel/button click is barely functional <i> .
1	This was my second cordless optical mouse I purchased for my laptop after the  <i> wheel broke <i>  on my first.
1	The application switcher (the thumb  <i> wheel) has inconsistent behavior <i> .
1	*********** My old Microsoft mouse was great; optical mouse, corded, never had a problem--but the mouse- <i> wheel had grown sticky <i> , defiant and ornery.
1	The  <i> thumbwheel, on the other hand, is a major annoyance <i> .
1	The MX Performance does a lot to improve the MX Rev, giving us charging-via-USB, an even more ergonomic design, riding us from the -imho-  <i> useless thumb wheel <i>  on the side, top-notch build quality and so on.
1	actually works on almost any surface and extremely powerful signal, the only problem is its size and the scroll  <i> wheel button is too hard <i> , and does not respond well to design programs is almost a torture,  for a normal job does not demand intensive use will be perfec.
1	4) Scroll  <i> wheel feels cheap <i>  and clicks loudly in "click" mode.
1	Unfortunately, the scroll  <i> wheel shifting mechanism was very clunky <i>  on the unit I received.
1	The  <i> wheel was permanently stuck <i>  in frictionless mode.
1	I'm assuming there is a hardware problem with the thumbwheel pushbutton-the function of the  <i> wheel pushbutton is not consistent <i>  throughout the entire rotation of the wheel.
1	I do occasionally play a computer game and the free flowing scroll  <i> wheel is a little too hard <i>  to be accurate with in games and for some reason I can't get the Logitech software to accurately realize when I'm playing a game.
1	The new  <i> wheel is as close to useless  <i> as possible.
1	It is a very good mouse except for the  <i> problems with the scroll wheel <i> .
1	The size also makes the already stiff scroll <i>  wheel seem even stiffer <i> , it takes more effort than should be necessary to click it.
1	And the whole advanced scroll  <i> wheel thing is really stupid <i>  unless you are scrolling a huge document.
1	If you even touch the wheel it moves, and when you actually push the button down (which feels cheap, by the way) the  <i> wheel again will randomly move <i> .
1	Within just a few months, the scroll  <i> wheel became resistant <i>  to moving.
1	My only complaint is one that others have noted, side scrolling via the mouse  <i> wheel is a pain <i> .
1	Cons: Weak transmitter, very short battery life, chrome starts to peel off, rubber  <i> scroll wheel comes off <i> .
