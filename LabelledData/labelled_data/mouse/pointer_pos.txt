0	I found this Logitech V470 picky on surfaces more pickier than my old optical mouses Some surfaces like my desk which has a light color non glossy surface worked fine with my old optical mouse but not too well with my new V470 I noticed if my V470 did not <p> like the working surface the pointer <p> became sluggish in motion . .
0	This Logitech is very easy on batteries but it still gives very precise <p> accurate pointer <p> control also frustrating when it's lacking which is often the case with wireless mice without being fussy about radio linking . .
0	A solid black fabric mouse pad <p> worked decently though the pointer <p> would slow down at certain points possibly due to dust and finer movements tended to be frustratingly difficult to make . .
0	I now realize how <p> sensitive the pointer <p> is and it's becoming an annoyance . .
0	Oh it has a setting that you can check off that gives it <p> enhanced pointer <p> precision but even though that is a great improvement over the old can't hit the broad side of a barn right out of the box setting on a finer level it still doesn't come close to the efficiency of the Logitech's plus when you reboot the computer the enhanced pointer precision goes right back to un ehanced pointer sloppy setting . .
0	The laser keeps the mouse fast and <p> accurate as far as pointer <p> tracking goes . .
0	The Logitech G5 was slightly better on reliability the Naga sometimes but rarely moves the <p> pointer to the top <p> of the screen maybe because I slightly lift it off the matt . .
0	Because there are so many buttons and me losing my place because of my hand slipping I had to forget about using two fingers up top in <p> favor of three fingers pointer <p> on mouse 1 index on scroll wheel ring on mouse 3 which basically meant I had to learn how to hold a mouse all over again . .
