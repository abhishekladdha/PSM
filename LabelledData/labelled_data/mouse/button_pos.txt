0	The 12 <p> button thumbgrid is easy <p> to access with a variety of hand shapes and sizes . .
1	<i> Terrible to clean the button <i> headers internally after a couple years usage . .
0	Overall because of its <p> ease of button configuring <p> since its all keyboard functions anyway . .

0	The synapse software makes programming macros and all the side <p> button functions extremely easy <p> . .

1	Good middle mouse <i> button not as good <i> as the Cyborg RAT or Steelseries Kai but better than the RAZER DeathAdder and on par with old school MS IntelliMouse . .
0	What's amazing is they've done this while keeping the mouse a reasonable size and having all but one <p> button within easy finger reach <p> . .
0	Although i can't mention the durability of the mouse having only owned it for a week i can tell you point blank that in terms of <p> comfort design and button <p> placement this is easily the most comfortable and useful mouse for a PC Gamer that i've ever used in my life . .
0	It's <p> hard not to know which button I'm pressing <p> . .
0	Optional wireless solid charging station switchable grips <p> good construction 17 buttons 12 button <p> number pad LED color options etc . .
