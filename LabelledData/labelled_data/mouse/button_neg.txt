1	My main problem is that some of  <i> button do not always do <i>  what they're supposed to do.
1	My second  <i> complaint is the middle mouse button <i>  (or the mouse wheel button).
1	This second MX Revolution, a few months old, is now starting to behave in the same way, it hesitates frequently when trying to move the cursor, and clicks to the index finger  <i> button do not always register <i> .
1	, Free Spin keeps changing to Non free spin,  <i> button simply don't respond to commands <i>  etc.
1	A lot of my movement functions are hindered because the middle mouse  <i> button is extremely touchy <i> .
1	Again the previous version worked much better for me but the middle mouse  <i> button was still somewhat glitchy <i>  just not nearly this bad.
1	I'm not sure about the switch application feature; I am used to using Alt+tab, and most of the time I  <i> bump the button when I don't want to <i> .
1	This mouse is quite large and is made for people with larger than average hands as I find the  <i> button to be uncomfortably distant <i> .
1	Pros: Small Long battery life Plug-and-Play, no need to setup anything Cons The wheel  <i> button makes a VERY irritating noise <i>  when turns Stops working sometimes, then you need to push the small button underneath to reset.
1	First the zoom  <i> button is completely not usable <i> , you accidentally hit it all the time because its exactly below the forward and backward button.
1	Everything else in the 1/4 C-Note range seemed like junk to me (and also no bluetooth,  <i> lack of button <i>  and not the best shape).
1	The Internet page Back and Forward  <i> button do not work as well <i>  for me as they did on the MX1000 and the search button is in a frustrating position directly under the scroll wheel which means that if you finger slips it hits the search button and up pops whatever engine you have designated.
1	Like the case with an earlier Microsoft wireless mouse I had, where the left-click  <i> button stopped working <i>  after some 3 years.
1	But mouse is utter $%##@& - Most  <i> frustrating is that damn middle button <i> .
1	Since I have never operated any of my free wheeling Logitech mice in any mode other than free wheeling, I am hoping to disassemble this one and remove the  <i> annoying button <i> .
1	The "zoom"  <i> button is misplaced <i>  in that it is positioned too close to the back button.
1	Beyond about five feet the  <i> button clicks become intermittent <i> .
1	The side button are not nearly as useful as the thumb wheel on the Revolution, the  <i> button placement is awkward <i> , too much of a reach.
1	The right and left  <i> button feel cheap <i>  and are also too much of a reach to be comfortable.
1	The only problem is that the mouse  <i> doesn't have an on/off button <i>  on it, which makes me worry about battery life.
1	What's worse, the zoom  <i> button is placed so closed <i>  to the other thumb button, making them very difficult to use.
1	Though this model does work fantastic on glass, the precision of the mouse cursor is great my main  <i> issues is the button configuration <i>  and the scroll wheel.
1	So there's 4 of 8  <i> "button" useless <i>  to me!
1	That's 5 of 8  <i> "button" now virtually useless <i> .
1	However, after a month of use, the left mouse  <i> button started randomly double-clicking <i>  about 50% of the tim, which is a disaster if you are doing CAD/CAM or Photoshop.
1	A general problem with the mouse and Logitech's software is that some of the  <i> button have a few weird bugs <i> , such when the 'search' button is remapped to a key combination (I use Ctrl+W), you may find your keyboard thinking that the Ctrl key is constantly held down, until you press it on the keyboard.
1	The left and right click  <i> button are loose <i>  and make a 'pinging' noise when released.
1	I wrote this article because I have recently had  <i> trouble with my left mouse button <i> .
1	With my normal-sized hands, as I hold the mouse the edge of that  <i> obnoxious button <i>  is constantly poking the under side of my index finger.
1	By comparison my much simpler Logitech wireless from a couple of years ago still works great and doesn't poke me with a  <i> useless button <i> .
1	Now I can remove the software and maybe it'll be smooth like how I wanted it, but that defeats the purpose of getting a new mouse, because w/o the software the horizontal scroll wheel becomes very slow and I  <i> lose the function of the other button <i> .
1	(The Microsoft Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000 has a programmable button, but the main button did not have as nice a feel, and the side  <i> button was difficult to use <i>  due to its placement, so I returned it after only a few days).
1	Also, the scroll wheel  <i> button is a bit stiff <i> .
1	There are some  <i> button that simply cannot be changed <i> , despite what SetPoint might tell you (the one-click search button is a prime example), and others that can be reset, but not in a way that will actually work consistently.
1	The connect  <i> button was pressed many times <i>  to try to get it to work with the receiver, which seems to be working as the light comes up when connected to usb port.
1	Despite the  <i> small button issues <i> , the mouse is easy to use and a worthy replacement for most corded and cordless mice.
1	I can swing both ways on this, but the problem is that the toggle  <i> button feels like a cheap piece of plastic <i> .
1	As other users have mentioned, the forward  <i> button is placed just a little too far <i>  forward on the mouse, requiring a thumb extension to reach.
1	This mouse looks and feels good, except that the plastic toggle  <i> button is very cheap <i> .
1	Be aware of the middle mouse  <i> button abscence <i> .
1	However, the middle mouse  <i> button is really not right <i> .
1	The main  <i> button were flimsy <i>  and felt like a $9 store brand mouse.
1	The left  <i> button squeaked constantly <i> , the right did not but required considerably more force to click.
1	The only complain I have is that the side  <i> button are not so easy to reach <i>  by my thumb.
1	Now, for the past couple of months, the left  <i> button has started to act funny <i> , and now, often when I click it, it performs a double-click.
1	My main complaint is that the  <i> functionality of the side button are gone <i> .
1	I realize that a lot of his  <i> issues with button mapping <i>  are software related, and I have those as well, but would like to add that the tracking (or lack thereof) is hardware related as there are a lot of people on the logitech boards on Windows boxes who are having identical issues to mine.
1	Oh, I must also say, my first MX had really  <i> 'loose' left and right click button <i>  - got it replaced and this one's fine.
1	but the left  <i> button on the mouse started to become unresponsive <i> .
1	Resets to defaults often,  <i> button not as programmable <i>  as they should be, interferes with SnagIt software.
1	I love logitech mice, love the Darkfield Technology, though too little click resistance with this mouse right clicker, your finger has to rest above the mouse, if it even barely touches the right click then it clicks (this should be adjustable) - also the forward and backward  <i> button are a bit to far forward <i> .
1	The asssigned  <i> button is cheap <i>  and malposition.
1	A quick run through: * Runs on a single aa battery - a nice touch * Has 4  <i> button - two are awkwardly designed <i>  * Boasts the trademarked MS BlueTrack technology - and it actually works!
1	I been using the corded mouse the computer came with, and I've had enough of me accidently hitting its super  <i> sensitive side button <i> .
1	I found it rather awkward and the  <i> button have become useless to me <i> .
1	button configuration - the three side  <i> button can be easily pressed accidentally <i>  and are very close together, making it hard to distinguish between them.
1	If you do a search on Google with "logitech left mouse  <i> button problem drag <i> ", you will find a lot of people are having similar issue with different models of Logitech mouse for since year 2009.
1	The scroll  <i> button is worse <i>  than Logitech's.
1	The bottom thumb button while a nice touch if it were in addition to the forward back thumb  <i> button is also awkward <i>  to hit.
1	Second the left mouse  <i> button is loose <i>  so that its constantly making little noises as I rest my finger on it.
1	I have also had to insert a piece of folded paper under the right click  <i> button because it was so sensitive <i> .
1	The  <i> button work sort of <i> , but you can't see a pointer anywhere so the mouse is useless.
1	The forward/back  <i> button are sort of a stretch to reach <i>  with my thumb too, so their not particularly convenient.
1	-Firstly the middle  <i> button doesn't 'click' <i> , there seems to be an issue within the housing of the scroll wheel and the push sensor.
1	and even then you usually end up  <i> inadvertently clicking the left or middle button <i>  as well.
1	First, the frequent creaks and  <i> squeaks emanating from the top button <i>  area whenever you click.
1	The second issue is the middle  <i> button is a little harder to press <i>  than expected.
1	If you just use the left&right clicks and the scroll then it should be fine, but I regularly use the other button while browsing the internet (redefined them with SetPoint) and you have to bend your thumb too far up into an  <i> unnatural way to press the button <i> ; my hand hurts only after a few days of use.
1	And the  <i> button are not even easy to press <i> , you have to apply quite a lot of force, which makes it worse.
1	Also, I found I  <i> cannot press the middle button <i>  (the scroll) without moving the scroll a little bit, which makes it useless - middle click on a link to open it in a new window becomes impossible, because the page scrolls while you press it.
1	and there is an  <i> odd button  <i> just behind the top scroll wheel that is driving me crazy - poor design on that.
1	The only complaint I have is that the wheel side scroll  <i> button are very hard to use <i>  when compared with my old MX1000 Logitech mouse.
1	the only down side i think i found was the scroll  <i> button is rougher to press <i>  than my last, but is far easier to actually scroll.
1	Too many  <i> button which seem to get engaged too easily <i>  (she completely dismissed the 'Document Flip' function and the whole concept of the side button after two inadvertant engagements of it).
1	The forward, back, and zoom  <i> button are a little awkward <i>  to operate.
1	This middle mouse  <i> button is a huge flaw <i> .
1	Also, for me personally, the  <i> button are not in as good a place <i>  for my hands as the Rev or MX 400 (though there are 10 of them!
1	Only complaint is that the middle mouse  <i> button is hard to click <i>  and to click and drag.
1	Issue #2: The middle  <i> button doesn't really work to well <i> , which has actually been a problem with a number of Logitech mice that I have used (and there have been many).
1	The forward and back  <i> button are not as accessible <i>  as my previous logitech as you have to bring your thumb up across the lip but overall i really like it.
1	That pervious mouse last a good 3+ years under heavy usage before one of the mouse  <i> button became an issue <i> .
1	The back and forward  <i> button is a bit high <i>  for the thumb in my opinion.
1	If you have small hands, the back/forward  <i> button may be a little uncomfortable <i>  to reach, but again, that's probably not a big deal.
1	The right mouse click  <i> button loses it's one click functionality <i>  soon.
1	Pros: 1) awesome scroll wheel for lightning fast scrolling for long documents and the ability to stop on a dime when needed 2) rechargeable battery + battery gauge 3) super smooth teflon feet 4) configurable button and jog wheel 5) fairly accurate compared to an optical mouse 6) solid build quality of the housing 7) weight well, not too heavy, not too light Cons: 1) inconsistent travel for the button, sometimes the  <i> button stick <i>  2) battery life could be better 3) logitech's software was horrendous (osx and windows) 4) choppy performance when there are other devices in the 2.
1	 <i> None of the button have a tactile feel <i>  to it, some have different stroke and travel, while others just feel like they want to stick.
1	The  back and forward  <i> button are placed kinda weird <i>  in a way that I am not used to.
1	I also encounter some  <i> problems with clicking the middle button <i> .
1	The middle  <i> button is very strange <i> , I can click it and it won't do anything sometimes.
1	The  <i> button are not very smooth <i>  when clicking, the scroll has no "clicking" while scrolling, it's just a smooth motion.
1	Honestly, the middle mouse  <i> button annoys me <i> , a lot.
1	) UPDATE 11/5/2011 After using this little mouse for a few months, I have to say that the middle mouse  <i> button still bothers me <i> .
1	I am taking a star away because this scroll  <i> button is becoming impossible to use <i>  without annoying the crap out of me!
1	Using this application to customize the  <i> button on the mouse was a little frustrating <i> .
1	--No second scroll wheel --Using middle click on the top scroll wheel, the  <i> button barely registers <i>  and you have to click about 5x to actually get the middle click function to work.
1	It has side button, and even though it's a small mouse (and the side  <i> button are very small <i> ) I don't find them hard to click.
1	as well, i'd say the whole design of the scroll wheel  <i> button is worse <i>  than previous logitech mice i've had (i've had all the recent top end mice).
1	this doesn't explain why the  <i> button doesn't actually work <i>  (all the other ones do), but it is a design flaw in my opinion.
1	Middle  <i> button is hard to press <i>  so are the pan-left pan-right button.
1	The middle scroll wheel: The wheel features smooth scrolling, which is nice; however it is also mounted with a ridiculously  <i> stiff button mechanism <i> .
1	Secondly, when attempting to execute a click on say, a browser tab, or otherwise utilize the middle click feature, the action of the  <i> button is often ignored <i> , meaning, you will click to close a browser tab, and nothing happens.
1	It's too small for average-large hands, the microscopic shoulder button are awkwardly placed, and the middle mouse  <i> button is much too stiff <i>  for all practical applications.
1	The middle mouse  <i> button is badly designed <i> .
1	* The middle mouse  <i> button is surprisingly hard to push <i>  down.
1	The side  <i> button do not work <i>  or are sporadic in their operation, and the scroll wheel stops unlocking to allow for free scroll, or vice versa.
1	The thing is, when I bought it from Amazon, the middle mouse  <i> button does not work <i>  more than 50% of the time.
1	The side  <i> button are hard to reach <i> .
1	Its left mouse  <i> button is starting to die <i> , but it still has rock-solid click-by-click scrolling - each notch of the scroll wheel is always exactly one line of movement.
1	A second annoying factor is that the left and right mouse  <i> button do not have the same tactile feel <i> ; one has a solid "click" when depressed while the other has a much smoother feel when depressed.
1	The two side  <i> button are about 10mm too high <i>  for comfortable use.
1	this is a $100 mouse with a silly gear shift,  <i> no middle mouse button <i> , and a useless web search button.
1	the  <i> button are not sensitive  <i> so you sometimes have to push them 2 or 3 times to get them to accept a click.
1	The right side  <i> button is awkward <i>  to press but doable however the wheel scroll button is just annoying.
1	The special  <i> button don't start working <i>  until after you install the Logitech software, but basic point and click stuff works fine, which was nice.
1	The middle  <i> button is what really blows <i>  on this mouse.
1	So, if you just simply can't live with a mouse that has a  <i> crappy middle button <i> , you may want to look elsewhere.
1	Next, let's talk about the  <i> useless button <i>  they added to this mouse.
1	*** Not-so-good 3-fuzzies feature ratings: *** On both this 6000 mouse and the Explorer Mini Mouse, clicking down on the scroll wheel to use it as the middle mouse  <i> button requires far too much force <i> , and it makes a loud clunky clicking sound, which tends to negate the really quiet nature of the left/right button and the silent scroll wheel.
1	And the other problem is that both the right-side and left-side page  <i> button are too small <i>  and positioned too much towards the front of the mouse body; the right-side page button would have been easier to press using my ring finger if it was either moved a bit away from the very front of the mouse, or if the button was lengthened in size.
1	Another mechanical problem may occur if the  <i> pushbutton latch fails <i>  or breaks, leaving the transceiver permanently latched inside the mouse body.
1	A bigger problem - for me anyways - is that now using the scrollwheel as a  <i> button is very dicey <i> .
1	I've heard professionals in other fields (mainly scientific and technical) complain that the Revolution's  <i> button can't be remapped <i>  to the most common-sense configurations for the mainstream apps they use day-in, day-out--configurations that other mice can adopt as a matter of course.
1	Update 11/12/10 - almost 2 years to the day I bought it the left mouse  <i> button is doing the dreaded double click <i> .
1	The additional  <i> button/functions will not work <i> , see below.
1	The mouse can be easily customized, but because the side  <i> button are hard to push <i>  I don't use this feature very often.
1	- ability to custom map functions to the various button Cons: - large and fairly heavy mouse requires a bit more effort and space to move around - only runs off a single AA battery - battery life is not very good (about 2-3 weeks) - SetPoint software only displays battery life as full/good/poor instead of the more accurate "XX days remaining" -  <i> button placement is awkward <i> .
1	That's too many  <i> button too close <i>  together.
1	- has  <i> fewer button to map <i>  than some other models.
1	Giving this 4-stars, even though I really wanted 5, just because of that top  <i> button problem <i> .
1	The wheel is great, I'm continuing to use the mouse, but the rest of the  <i> button are mostly useless <i> .
1	Cons: 1) The biggest single drawback of the MX Revolution - even bigger than its exorbitant price - is that the microswitch under the left mouse  <i> button is weak <i>  and usually fails in well under one year, depending on how often and how hard you use the mouse.
1	I thought it strange actually, that the  <i> button seemed to not fit <i>  the rest of this very ergo-looking mouse.
1	Recently, my new mouse's scroll wheel  <i> button stopped working <i> .
1	The actual action of the  <i> button doesn't press <i>  from the center but on the far left edge.
1	My only con for this mouse is that in Maya 3D the middle mouse  <i> button is a little finicky <i>  in advanced hold and move functions.
1	Background info: before this, I was using the MX600 cordless laser mouse that came as part of the MX3200 wireless package; which I have also been very satisfied with except 1) I hated having to go through batteries so fast (was replacing the batteries on the mouse on average maybe once every 4-6 weeks) and 2) after a bit over a year, the  <i> button on the mouse became noticeably less responsive <i>  as I had to exert a noticeable amount of force for the clicks to register.
1	The unusually high tension on the wheel  <i> button can be a bit annoying <i> , and I wonder if it might be bad for carpal tunnel-type problems.
1	Much less than the 6 months I was getting with my previous mobile mouse, the original arc mouse (that I finally had to replace when the right click  <i> button became wonky <i> ).
1	The left  <i> button has also stopped working consistently <i> .
1	Middle mouse  <i> button is too rigid <i> .
1	Left  <i> button either wouldn't work <i>  or it acted like a double click.
1	The wheel  <i> button became useless <i>  doing the same things as described here.
1	I took the hint that a new mouse was in order when the  <i> paint wore off the left mouse button <i>  and the wheel stopped scrolling to the left.
1	It's not that it's an eyesore, and even the fact that I feel the height difference with my fingers isn't a problem, but I've noticed that the right  <i> button is a bit stiff <i> , possibly for the same reason.
1	pressing the middle  <i> button requires significant pressure <i> , and just isn't comfortable.
1	The forward and backward  <i> button are too slim <i>  that you have to click them carefully being afraid of breaking them.
1	i would like to be able to have more configuration options for the zoom button, especially since the middle  <i> button is not reliable <i> .
1	If I put the receiver on the back of my desktop PC, or across my desk in my laptop docking station, I get intermittent pauses and  <i> unresponsive button clicks <i> .
1	Other users complain their thumb is too short (probably because they have normal length fingers), because the  <i> button are pretty far <i>  forward.
1	This isn't an issue for me, but the  <i> button are absolutely too high <i> .
1	This revolution mouse has a ton of button, which can be configured to be situationally useful, but so far the extra  <i> button haven't been as useful <i>  as I thought they would be.
1	They should have put both side button on the left side of the mouse for right handed users to use with their thumb, because the right side  <i> button isn't easy to hit <i> .
1	I haven't used this in a long time, but having it at a desktop now I notice the wheel  <i> button is accidentally pressed <i>  all the time, there is not much of a "click" either.
1	But its forward and backward  <i> button are not friendly <i>  designed.
1	Battery  <i> button was stuck  <i> when I received but works fine now.
1	I didn't notice this mentioned in other reviews until after I bought it, but the middle wheel/ <i> button click is barely functional <i> .
1	*) (* key selling point *) - Low resistance scroll - Multiple button can be customized to different tasks And the caveat as to why I rated it low and returned (2) mice and bought another: - Mouse #1 - middle  <i> button was intermittent <i>  - Mouse #2 - middle button worked, but had to be pushed at a certain angle to trigger, which was different given the length of my middle finger, which I would term average.
1	Then one day, all the extra  <i> button stopped working completely <i> .
1	actually works on almost any surface and extremely powerful signal, the only problem is its size and the scroll wheel  <i> button is too hard <i> , and does not respond well to design programs is almost a torture,  for a normal job does not demand intensive use will be perfec.
1	2) Forward/backward thumb  <i> button are a bit high <i> .
1	3) Right/Left click  <i> button are supper sensitive <i> , as I often clicked when I didn't want to.
1	The problem I have with it is that the side  <i> button are in the wrong place <i> .
1	This one, the side  <i> button on the left is too high <i>  and too far forward and I have to move my whole hand and twist it around, then the whole mouse moves out of position making it unecessarily awkward to use.
1	Other than the side  <i> button issue <i>  this is a great little mouse.
1	The middle  <i> button works randomly <i> .
1	I'm assuming there is a hardware problem with the thumbwheel pushbutton-the function of the wheel  <i> pushbutton is not consistent <i>  throughout the entire rotation of the wheel.
1	On the defective mouse, the scroll wheel worked, the right  <i> button worked intermittently <i> , but the pointer wouldn't move.
1	I'm also finding that the left click  <i> button is inconsistent <i> .
1	The issue with the left  <i> button having problems <i>  is real and very annoying.
1	Then all the extra  <i> button are pretty much useless <i> .
1	Document Flip and the Search  <i> button are completely worthless <i> .
1	The movement quality went down, and the main click  <i> button is almost dead <i>  - I have to really bang on it for the click to be noticed.
1	As the battery drains each  <i> button will disappear <i>  and finally the LED will turn red letting you know its almost out of juice.
1	Button location, not the same as the Revolution, looks similiar but you have to really move your fingers to engage the side button which is important when doing production work, not being able to program the button behind the wheel and its sensitive right and left  <i> button made it impossible to use <i>  with Autocad.
