1	The issue with this mouse is that it is necessary to  <i> charge the battery frequently <i> , and the only method of accomplishing this is to plug in a cord.
1	The only down side for this mouse is the  <i> battery life is real short <i>  maybe about a week at best then you need to charge it other then that it is a nice mouse.
1	 <i> battery dies constantly <i>  (this is why rechargeable battery sucks, i'll have to buy another one) 5.
1	I am still going to give it a low rating because the  <i> battery only lasts a few weeks <i>  at a time and this is unacceptable to me.
1	Firstly,  <i> battery life is terrible <i> .
1	The  <i> battery life is moderate <i>  as I haven't run out of battery yet, but I turn it off a lot.
1	Update: After a month with the mouse my experience with it is generally good however I will have to say that at least on mine there is obviously a  <i> battery issue <i>  as I am lucky to get 4 days of moderate use without having to charge it.
1	Limited charging capacities, and can't be swapped out when the  <i> battery eventually goes on to holding crappy charges <i> .
1	It is made well overall, nothing seems to be coming apart (although the  <i> battery door is a bit wobbly <i> , but that probably happens after a bit of use).
1	The AA  <i> battery life is too short <i> .
1	The only problem is that the mouse doesn't have an on/off button on it, which makes me  <i> worry about battery life <i> .
1	), sometimes it doesn't stay, and you have to make sure it's pushed in or else the  <i> battery won't shut off <i> .
1	The MX Revolution with its built-in  <i> battery cannot be used <i>  while charging.
1	The mouse was worth the price I paid for, however, since early this year, it's been disconnecting at random times and the  <i> battery is no longer accurate <i> .
1	When the  <i> battery runs out of juice <i>  it is no big deal you just have to plug it in with the provided USB cable and you can continue using the mouse as usual.
1	The  <i> battery life isn't great <i> , but you can leave your 'other' mouse tethered to your PC for those 'just in case' moments when the MX decides to take a nap.
1	I had been using the Logitech MX1000 Laser Cordless mouse and needed to upgrade because the  <i> battery in that model is not replaceable <i> , and it would not hold a charge longer than 1 day.
1	The  <i> battery doesn't last <i>  a super long time between charges however it's easy to charge the mouse while using it via the included USB charging cable (so what if it becomes a 'wired' mouse for the couple of hours it's charging).
1	I fully charged this mouse when it arrived and the  <i> battery was dead <i>  within 24 hours.
1	After reading more about this mouse, it seems the Performance MX has been getting panned since day 1 due to  <i> poor battery life <i> .
1	Fix the  <i> battery issue <i>  and you have a solid 4.
1	After an hour of frustration, the area with the  <i> battery got very hot <i>  and I had to take the battery out.
1	I was worried that the  <i> limited battery life <i>  would be a problem, but it's been good for more than a week, and charging it is like using a wired mouse for a little while - no big deal.
1	This was my second wireless mouse because the first one gave away due to tons of  <i> issues like battery life <i> , flickering pointer motion etc.
1	Seems like the engineers knew this  <i> thing was a battery hog <i> , and gave us a way to charge it while still being able to use it, because I can only imagine the deluge of complaints otherwise.
1	Aside from the  <i> battery problems <i> , the mouse itself is great.
1	But I really hate the  <i> pathetic battery life <i> .
1	Im not a fan of rechargable things that are used often because the  <i> battery life is always poor <i> .
1	Also the  <i> battery mounting is a poor <i>  design.
1	The  <i> battery life, however, isn't too great <i> .
1	I bought this item two months ago and the  <i> battery has already gone bad <i> .
1	One, i can't get the cool "thumb" button to work in any games I have and two: this sucker  <i> sucks down the battery life <i> .
1	Also, the  <i> battery life is very marginal <i> .
1	First the  <i> battery doesn't seem to last <i>  very long, which is concerning because you have to plug this in while you are working to recharge.
1	The so-called rechargeable  <i> battery is next to useless <i> .
1	I am not sure if it is just a  <i> bad battery <i>  or a flawed design.
1	 <i> short battery life <i>  - if used regularly, you will have to recharge the batteries at least monthly.
1	That specific mouse has  <i> poor battery life <i>  due to the high performance, but it is rechargeable by plugging in to usb when not in use (or you can still use it and charge at the same time if needed.
1	My issue is with the fact that after only 2 weeks of usage, the  <i> battery seems to be going dead <i>  already.
1	It takes twice as long to charge up but, get this, lasts over twice as long as the stock  <i> junk battery <i> .
1	My only complaint is that the  <i> battery charge doesn't last <i>  as long as regular batteries would.
1	Go to the Logitech forums (forums dot logitech dot com) and read what issues people have been having with the batteries (inability to recharge, frequent loss of mouse precision due to  <i> battery issues <i> , etc).
1	It seems every time I look over I see a red light or I get cut-off mid-project when the  <i> battery dies <i> .
1	Also, the  <i> battery is not replaceable <i> .
1	Another edit: as of 6/7/10 I haven't had any of the shorting out problems with this that I've had with the similar but corded MX-400 Last edit 10/11: the  <i> battery will no longer take a charge <i> .
1	However,  <i> the battery life is very poor <i> .
1	The  <i> poor battery life <i>  results in the mouse effectively being "wired" instead of "wireless".
1	Many times there are  <i> no warnings that battery levels are critical <i>  until you return to your PC the next morning.
1	I would have preferred to have spent this much and gotten a razer, especially because the  <i> battery doesn't last very long <i>  on the mouse.
1	I was told the  <i> battery was not replaceable <i>  on the Revolution (though oddly I have since seen several specialty retailers selling the "non replaceable" battery?
1	Another edit: as of 6/7/10 I haven't had any of the shorting out problems with this that I've had with the similar but corded MX-400 Last edit 10/11: the  <i> battery will no longer take a charge <i> .
1	maybe the  <i> battery is too old <i> ?
1	is a good mouse it does what it says however is too heavy for comfort and the  <i> battery doesn't last long <i>  you have to put the usb cord to it every 3days to charge it.
1	Pros: 1) awesome scroll wheel for lightning fast scrolling for long documents and the ability to stop on a dime when needed 2) rechargeable battery + battery gauge 3) super smooth teflon feet 4) configurable buttons and jog wheel 5) fairly accurate compared to an optical mouse 6) solid build quality of the housing 7) weight well, not too heavy, not too light Cons: 1) inconsistent travel for the buttons, sometimes the buttons stick 2)  <i> battery life could be better <i>  3) logitech's software was horrendous (osx and windows) 4) choppy performance when there are other devices in the 2.
1	I can use it easily from 20 feet away (like a remote to my computer while watching Netflix or something) Update 11/12/2011 The  <i> battery just died <i> .
1	but the  <i> battery life is as cheap <i>  as it can be.
1	After several months of use I did sometimes experience a bit of a  <i> problem with the battery <i>  connection.
1	The only real  <i> problem is that the battery pack <i> , which is internal and rechargeable, runs out of juice after a three or four hours.
1	my only complaint is the  <i> horrid battery life <i> .
1	This product has a very  <i> poor battery life <i> .
1	Very, very  <i> poor battery life <i> : included rechargeable battery has to be recharged every week, then I tried alkaline battery, holds the charge for two weeks.
1	The mouse is very comfortable for average size hands, it's very reliable and precise on movements, but it consumes the  <i> battery life too fast <i> .
1	I may simply have a  <i> defective battery <i>  which, if so, would greatly change my rating.
1	The rechargeable  <i> battery failed <i>  in less than a week.
1	This new method, I think, is way better than the dock system they used before, especially if your on the go with a laptop, just plug it into your laptop when the  <i> battery is dying <i> !
1	-  <i> battery life is low <i>  - I miss the thumb wheel.
1	The only time I have had any issues is when the  <i> battery starts getting weak <i> , and then once the battery is replaced it works perfectly again.
1	The mouse is nice, but the pain of the <i>  battery issues <i>  just isn't worth it.
1	Initially they are good mice, the  <i> battery power is not very long <i>  especially if you do gaming though the charging doesn't take real long either, generally you won't use it up entirely over a day unless you really push it.
1	The battery life started out good, but as of this week, a short 6 months after I bought it, the  <i> battery life is a joke <i> .
1	After being on the charger all night it was telling me that " <i> battery life is critical <i> " by early afternoon.
1	I am a regular logitech mouse user, but with this one I am disappointed because its  <i> battery lasts only about 2  days  <i> on a full charge.
1	I ll start off by saying this is my first wireless mouse in many years - I tried them back when  <i> battery life was pretty poor  <i> and range was rather short.
1	Eventually it sorts itself out, but I can t quite pin this down to line-of-sight or  <i> battery issues <i>  or something yet discovered.
1	My only real  <i> problem is the battery life <i> .
1	I would recommend this mouse as long as you don't mind some minor  <i> battery issues <i>  and instructions that aren't super clear about how to get it working.
1	CONS - The  <i> battery is not replaceable <i> , so when it dies, you have to buy a new mouse.
1	It's not a bad mouse at all, but after a week of use at work (not even using the Logitech software), the  <i> battery level is down <i> .
1	Bad: The  <i> battery only lasts <i>  about six hours before needing a charge.
1	Plus it's  <i> not as battery efficient <i>  as it likes to boast about on the blister pack.
1	believe me if I could trade the time I have wasted fiddling around with this mouse it would be worth it if it  <i> needed battery replaced <i>  within a couple of weeks, my peace of mind is worth that and much more.
1	Oh, one more thing, the issue about the  <i> POOR DURATION of the battery <i>  is also true.
1	1/3/2010 - update After a couple more months of use, I've determined that  <i> battery life isn't very good <i>  with rechargeable or regular batteries.
1	The  <i> battery life is unacceptable <i> , too and sometimes the battery will be down to almost nothing in less than 24 hours.
1	I've contacted Logitech for another replacement but I'm not thrilled with the fact that 2 separate units have serious  <i> battery issues <i> .
1	Thought I'd splurge and get this one with all of its features and extra buttons but the  <i> battery life is a real letdown <i> .
1	I am not experiencing the  <i> battery issues <i>  other users are.
1	However, as in all devices where the  <i> battery is irreplacable <i> , I worry that it will die eventually.
1	It operates just as well but the  <i> battery life is pretty bad <i> .
1	I hear the EasyCall desktop was discontinued precisely because the  <i> battery life blew <i> , and I fully believe that; I thusly come from a product that required new batteries every two months, three if I got lucky.
1	Performs as expected but has a  <i> shorter battery life <i>  than other wireless mice i've purchased.
1	This thing will die one day and I will have to throw it out because the  <i> battery is non replaceable <i> , kind of a bummer but I am looking forward to Logitechs next design like this.
1	Pretty  <i> heavy due to battery <i> , compared to a G9 with weights or G500 if you are wondering.
1	Battery: It is rechargeable, but I have noticed that the  <i> battery life varies <i>  and typically isn't that long.
1	I finally gave up trying to use this mouse as a wireless mouse due to the  <i> dismal battery life <i> .
1	I do worry a bit that the  <i> battery cover may become loose <i>  over time, simply due to the way it's designed, but so far, I've had no problems.
1	The only bad thing I have to say is the  <i> battery does not last as long <i>  as they say it will.
1	" This is a  <i> cheap quality battery <i>  and you will have to recharge it every often.
1	2 compatible - Great Microsoft hardware support CONS: - No auto-off feature - Real-life  <i> battery life significantly less <i>  than rating - Glossy plastic hard to keep clean and hard to grip - No carry case The blister pack was actually easy to open and did not require any tools.
1	I totally agree with other reviewers about the  <i> battery life issues <i> , but I find that even with constant use I only have to change the battery at most twice a month (thank god for rechargeables).
1	It is made well overall, nothing seems to be coming apart (although the  <i> battery door is a bit wobbly <i> , but that probably happens after a bit of use).
1	While the mouse has a great feel and works well, the  <i> battery life is horrific <i> .
1	The worst thing besides quality, is the  <i> battery life <i> , basically no more than a week even under light usage, and one or two days under intense use like gaming.
1	Overall, this mouse has great features, but it is too  <i> hindered by battery life <i>  and needing to wake it up.
1	The  <i> battery life is so poor <i> , and the mouse goes to sleep so quickly, that the function of the product is ruined by these bugs.
1	- this mouse uses a NiMH  <i> battery which is of much poorer quality <i>  than the Li-ion batteries that were used in some previous models.
1	Problems : The range on this mouse is very limited, the  <i> battery life is short <i>  (The mouse seems to always be on.
1	The only issue I have experienced with this product is that on occasion, the USB connector (when inserted into the bottom slot on the mouse) does not make a proper connection (telling the mouse to shut off) and the  <i> battery eventually dies <i> .
1	For one, the  <i> battery doesn't last very long <i>  so you need to recharge it constantly.
1	- From other reviews, the  <i> battery doesn't lasts as long <i> , a week or more at most.
1	The  <i> battery life isn't that great <i> .
1	The only thing I don't like about this mouse - the  <i> battery goes dead every few days <i>  and I have to recharge it.
1	I would swap one in when the other needed charging till one completely died ( <i> battery is not "user replaceable" <i> ).
1	Cons: Weak transmitter,  <i> very short battery life <i> , chrome starts to peel off, rubber scroll wheel comes off.
