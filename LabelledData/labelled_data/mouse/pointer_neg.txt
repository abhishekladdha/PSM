1	The mouse  <i> pointer would stop  <i> midway and then act as if the mouse was not plugged in constantly, then work again like normal.
1	For short periods of time every so often the mouse  <i> pointer will stop <i>  moving and you can't click anything, but then shortly after it starts working again.
1	This one has one as well but its only to change the scroll mouse, and the search button or third button is moved pressing the scroll wheel which is terrible because you have to press so hard that your  <i> pointer moves away <i>  from the word selected and then it doesn't search.
1	This is probably the cause of the "unresponsive" or "jittery/ <i> resetting pointer <i> " problems some people report.
1	For example, there is  <i> no option for pointer acceleration <i>  which is critical on iMacs because Apple insists on making its users feel as though they're mousing through molasses.
1	Most of the time the  <i> pointer moves erratically <i>  or not at all.
1	This was my second wireless mouse because the first one gave away due to tons of issues like battery life,  <i> flickering pointer motion <i>  etc.
1	) The  <i> pointer motion is not smooth <i> .
1	That's not a huge deal, but the deal breaker comes when you attempt to use the side-scrolling feature (which I use a lot on documents and emails) and you quickly realize the wheel will shake up and down and your  <i> pointer on screen starts going crazy <i> .
1	The buttons work sort of, but you  <i> can't see a pointer <i>  anywhere so the mouse is useless.
1	Instead of being smooth movement across the screen, the  <i> pointer will jump <i>  all over the place if it moves at all.
1	the mouse  <i> pointer just jumps <i>  from place to other.
1	and when u click the  <i> pointer moves away <i>  from the place where u clicked.
1	i dont know if its just mine, but at times my mouse  <i> pointer will go crazy <i> .
1	One problem it occasionally stops working  <i> pointer will move <i> only small distances and not to the top of screen at all.
1	It's as if the mouse had a minimum distance it must travel to register a movement, so the  <i> pointer would essentially 'jump' <i>  from one point to another.
1	Now I can see this mouse being minimally acceptable for users just surfing the web or general home use where big buttons and easy to hit links help make up for grossly  <i> inaccurate pointer movement <i> .
1	The  <i> pointer will freeze <i>  occassionally, the other times the the mouse pointer will jump across the screen in response for a small move.
1	it 'works', but the  <i> pointer is either very jumpy <i> , or extremely sluggish.
1	The 3000 model also has "improved" tracking precision, which means very erratic  <i> unprovoked spantaneous movements of the pointer <i>  in real life.
1	It worked for 3 months, then today the  <i> pointer stopped moving <i> , I went to unplug the wireless USB transmitter and burned my fingers.
1	Yes, it is very comfortable and yes it is a relatively good mouse if you can stand the  <i> pointer stuttering <i>  and lagging for a brief second everytime anything loads.
1	You may see your  <i> pointer dance around <i>  if you use your leg or the bed, but apparently this is more or less normal with Logitech laser mice.
1	* If other people are using the same mouse in the vicinity, the signals get distorted and you occasionally  <i> loose control on the pointer <i> .
1	I would slide the mouse across the screen (left to right) and the  <i> pointer would track erratically <i>  up and down as it moved.
1	About a week of great use then out of nowhere the mouse  <i> pointer started to lag <i>  and became unresponsive.
1	On the defective mouse, the scroll wheel worked, the right button worked intermittently, but the  <i> pointer wouldn't move <i> .
1	on gaming sometimes  <i> pointer just goes <i>  wacko mouse feels nice.
1	Even at that distance, which is never more than 12" to 18" I still occasionally get a "weak signal" popup notification on my screen, followed by  <i> erratic pointer movement <i> .
1	It may be my cluttered computer as I haven't formatted in awhile but I wasn't happy with the  <i> pointer skipping around <i> .
